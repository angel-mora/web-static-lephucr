# File Manager for Programmers

## âœ… TODOs


## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Tell me a UI that helps manage files. What sort of contents would it have? Consider it would be something like a filesystem assistant that helps you deal with markdown based notes and all your media (photos, video, etc) managed over markdown config files. I presume it would have colored folders for most visited, it would show recently opened files, it would show  a calendar. Tell me what kind of things it would need to be useful for programmer to unify the management of their computers. Also tell me what it would need to be useful for mobile web/files browsing and if there any project that are similar to Chromium/Obsidian(with notes, calendars and kanbans)/OneTab, etc

Tell me a UI that helps manage files. What sort of contents would it have? Consider it would be something like a filesystem assistant that helps you deal with markdown based notes and all your media (photos, video, etc) managed over markdown config files. I presume it would have colored folders for most visited, it would show recently opened files, it would show  a calendar.

The UI you're describing for a filesystem assistant that manages markdown-based notes, media files, and other content seems quite comprehensive and user-friendly. To make it useful for a programmer and also adaptable for mobile web/files browsing, here are some key features and contents it would need:

### Features for a Programmer's Filesystem Assistant

1. **Markdown-based Note Management**: Integrated editor for markdown files with syntax highlighting, live preview, and version control.

2. **Media File Organization**: Ability to tag, categorize, and preview media files (photos, videos, etc.) directly within the UI. 

3. **Colored Folders and Tags**: Customizable color-coded folders and tags for organizing and quickly identifying most-used or project-specific files.

4. **Recent Files and History Tracking**: A dashboard or sidebar showing recently opened or modified files, along with a detailed history log.

5. **Calendar Integration**: A built-in calendar to track deadlines, reminders, and link to specific notes or files.

6. **Advanced Search and Filters**: Robust search functionality with filters for file types, dates, tags, and content within files.

7. **Multi-Window and Tab Management**: Similar to OneTab, enabling users to open multiple files or notes in tabs within the same window for easy comparison and editing.

8. **Code Repository Integration**: Integration with Git or other version control systems for easy code management and collaboration.

9. **Customizable Shortcuts and Macros**: For quicker navigation and task completion, especially useful in a programming context.

10. **Plugin or Extension Support**: To allow additional functionalities like kanban boards, task management, etc., similar to what Obsidian offers.

### Features for Mobile Web/File Browsing

1. **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.

2. **Touchscreen Optimization**: Gestures for easy navigation, like swiping to change directories or pinch to zoom in media preview.

3. **Offline Access and Sync**: Ability to access and edit files offline, with changes syncing once online.

4. **Cloud Integration**: Seamless integration with cloud storage services for accessing and managing files across devices.

5. **Data Compression and Optimization**: For faster loading and less data usage, especially important in a mobile context.

### Similar Projects or Tools

1. **Chromium-Based Browsers**: For web browsing with extensions support, similar to how OneTab functions.

2. **Obsidian**: A markdown-based note-taking app that supports plugins for calendars, kanban boards, etc.

3. **VSCode or Atom**: Code editors with extensive plugin ecosystems, markdown support, and Git integration, although primarily desktop-based.

4. **Nextcloud**: An open-source cloud storage solution that can be self-hosted, offering file management, calendar, and more.

5. **Joplin**: An open-source note-taking and to-do application with markdown support, which can sync with various cloud services.

To develop such a comprehensive tool, one would need to consider a balance between feature richness and usability, ensuring that the interface remains intuitive and not overly cluttered, especially on mobile devices. Integrating existing open-source projects or using their plugins (where possible) can also enhance functionality without reinventing the wheel.
