Give me a overview of prolog and datalog

Sure, I'd be happy to give you an overview of Prolog and Datalog. Both of these are declarative programming languages, which express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. They are often used in artificial intelligence and database management systems.

**Prolog**

Prolog (short for "Programming in Logic") is a general-purpose logic programming language that is associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It was first created in the 1970s at the University of Marseilles. Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is declarative: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules.

Key Features:
- Uses a form of symbolic logic known as predicate calculus.
- Knowledge is represented as "facts" and "rules".
- Prolog has mechanisms for structuring data and controlling rule execution.
- Backtracking: Prolog uses this technique to find alternative solutions.
- It has list-processing capabilities, similar to Lisp.
- Typically used in AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing).

**Datalog**

Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that is a subset of Prolog. It was originally designed for database query languages in the 1980s. Datalog is used primarily as a query language for deductive databases, in essence, for scenarios where you have a large number of facts, and you want to make complex queries over those facts.

Key Features:
- Datalog is a subset of Prolog but with some important restrictions.
- Datalog does not have functions; it only has constants and variables. This difference leads to what is known as the "finite model property", meaning every Datalog program has a finite output.
- Datalog queries can be optimized for databases.
- Datalog is often used for static program analysis in computer science.

In summary, while both Prolog and Datalog are logic programming languages, Prolog is more general-purpose and often used in AI and computational linguistics, while Datalog, being a subset of Prolog with fewer features, is more specifically used for querying databases and for static program analysis.
