ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Telegra.ph is open source?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

No, **Telegra.ph** is not open source. It is a minimalist publishing tool created by Telegram, which allows users to create and share articles quickly without registration. However, the source code for Telegra.ph has not been released publicly, so it cannot be modified or self-hosted like open-source software.

There are open-source alternatives, though, such as **Plume**, **WriteFreely**, or **Ghost**, which offer similar functionality and can be self-hosted if you're looking for more control and customization.
