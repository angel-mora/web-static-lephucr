MYP-3962: How do I update a dependency in a gemfile.lock? I'm trying to update ruby-saml from omniauth-saml

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To update a dependency in your `Gemfile.lock`, such as `ruby-saml` from `omniauth-saml`, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Update the Gemfile**: Open your `Gemfile` and modify the line where `omniauth-saml` is listed, specifying the version of `ruby-saml` you want to update to, if applicable.

   For example:
   ```ruby
   gem 'omniauth-saml', '~> version_number'
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are directly updating `ruby-saml`, add it or update it in your `Gemfile`:
   ```ruby
   gem 'ruby-saml', '~> version_number'
   ```

2. **Run Bundler to update**: After modifying the `Gemfile`, run the following command to update the dependency and regenerate the `Gemfile.lock`:
   ```bash
   bundle update ruby-saml
   ```

   This command will update `ruby-saml` and any other dependencies required by it. It will then update your `Gemfile.lock` file accordingly.

3. **Verify the update**: After running the command, check the `Gemfile.lock` to confirm that the `ruby-saml` version has been updated.

4. **Test your application**: Make sure to run your tests or try running the application to verify that the updated dependency does not cause any issues.
