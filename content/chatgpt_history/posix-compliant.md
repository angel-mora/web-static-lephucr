What is posix-compliant? 

A POSIX-compliant system adheres to a set of standards specified by the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX). These standards are defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and aim to ensure compatibility and interoperability between various Unix-like operating systems. The POSIX specifications cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Shell and utilities: Defining command-line interfaces and utilities common to Unix-like systems.
- System APIs: Specifications for system calls and libraries that provide interfaces to system resources and services, such as process creation, file manipulation, and inter-process communication.
- Programming language interfaces: Standards for using system APIs in the C programming language, ensuring that applications can be developed in a way that is portable across compliant systems.
- Threads: Specifications for thread creation, synchronization, and management, facilitating the development of multi-threaded applications.
- File system hierarchy and permissions: Guidelines for the structure of file systems and the management of file permissions, aiming for consistency across systems.

By adhering to these and other related standards, operating systems aim to increase their compatibility with applications and scripts developed for other POSIX
