For cooking a ribeye in the oven, using the "bake" mode is typically recommended to ensure an even cooking process throughout the steak. You might start by searing the ribeye on a skillet over high heat to develop a crust, then transfer

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

For cooking a ribeye in the oven, using the "roast" mode with convection (if available) is ideal. Convection roasting circulates hot air around the meat, cooking it more evenly and often more quickly than traditional baking. This method is especially good for a ribeye as it helps render the fat, leading to a juicier, more flavorful steak. Begin by preheating your oven, use a high heat (around 400Â°F or 204Â°C) to get a nice sear on the outside while keeping the inside tender and juicy. Remember to let the steak rest before slicing to retain its juices.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

After preheating your oven to a high temperature for searing, such as 400Â°F (204Â°C), you may not need to adjust the temperature if you're using a convection roast setting, as this method efficiently circulates the air to cook the ribeye evenly and quickly. However, if you find the outside is cooking too fast compared to the inside, or if you're using a traditional bake setting without convection, you could lower the temperature slightly to around 375Â°F (190Â°C) after placing the steak in the oven. This allows for a more gentle cook through the middle of the steak while still achieving a nicely browned exterior. Keep in mind, cooking times will vary based on the thickness of the steak and your desired level of doneness, so using a meat thermometer is the best way to ensure it's cooked to your liking.
