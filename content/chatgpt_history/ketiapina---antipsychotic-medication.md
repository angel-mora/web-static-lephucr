🤖 **Assistant:**

"Ketiapina" seems to be a misspelling or alternative name for Quetiapine, a medication sold under the brand name Seroquel among others. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. It has a sedating effect, which sometimes leads to its use as a sleep aid, although the benefits for sleep must be weighed against potential undesirable side effects【3:1†source】.
