ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The order in which you perform MMA (or cardio) and weightlifting depends on your fitness goals. Here are some considerations:

### If Your Goal is to Build Muscle and Strength:
- **Do Weightlifting First:** Starting with weightlifting when your muscles are fresh allows you to lift heavier weights and perform exercises with better form, maximizing muscle and strength gains.

### If Your Goal is to Improve Cardiovascular Fitness or MMA Performance:
- **Do MMA/Cardio First:** Doing MMA or cardio first can improve your cardiovascular endurance and help you focus on the specific skills and intensity required for your MMA training.

### If Your Goal is General Fitness or Weight Loss:
- **Combination Approach:** You can alternate the order based on your focus for the day. Some days, prioritize weightlifting, and on other days, prioritize MMA or cardio. This can help balance strength, endurance, and overall fitness.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Energy Levels:** Consider your personal energy levels and how you feel during each type of workout. Some people find they have more energy for weightlifting if they do it first.
- **Time and Scheduling:** Practical factors like the time you have available and your training schedule might also influence the order.
- **Recovery:** Ensure you allow adequate recovery time between sessions to avoid overtraining and reduce the risk of injury.

### Practical Example:
- **Strength Focus Day:** Start with weightlifting to ensure you can lift heavy weights with good form, then follow with a lighter MMA session or cardio.
- **Endurance Focus Day:** Start with a high-intensity MMA session or cardio workout, then follow with lighter weightlifting focusing on form and endurance.

Ultimately, it's important to listen to your body and adjust based on how you feel and your specific fitness goals. Experimenting with different orders can help you find what works best for you.
