Two individuals who have made significant contributions to geopolitics and social entrepreneurship with a focus on U.S.-Mexico cooperation and a Chicano or bilateral perspective include:

1. **Henry Cisneros** - Cisneros has been influential in bridging the gap between the U.S. and Mexico through his extensive work in urban development and housing. As the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, Cisneros worked on improving housing policies that indirectly impacted U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in border areas. After retiring from political office, he continued to influence urban development and housing policies through his work in the private sector, focusing on creating sustainable and inclusive urban communities.

2. **Vicente Fox** - The former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox has been a vocal advocate for improved U.S.-Mexico relations and has worked on various initiatives aimed at fostering better cooperation between the two countries. Since leaving office, Fox has been involved in several social entrepreneurship ventures and has spoken extensively about the importance of U.S.-Mexico collaboration to address shared challenges such as immigration, drug trafficking, and economic development.

These individuals exemplify the commitment to fostering a cooperative and understanding relationship between Mexico and the United States, both during their official tenures and in their retirement through various social and economic initiatives.

Here are two individuals who have made significant contributions to geopolitics and social entrepreneurship from an academic or activist perspective, focusing on U.S.-Mexico cooperation:

1. **Noam Chomsky** - Although primarily known for his work in linguistics and political criticism, Chomsky has also commented extensively on U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in the context of trade agreements and economic policies. His critiques often highlight the impact of these policies on social justice and human rights, providing a critical academic perspective on how geopolitical strategies affect populations.

2. **Rodolfo ‚ÄúCorky‚Äù Gonzales** - As a key figure in the Chicano Movement, Gonzales advocated for Mexican-American rights and empowerment through cultural nationalism. His work not only shaped Chicano identity but also promoted social and political change, influencing U.S.-Mexico relations by foregrounding the experiences and rights of Mexican-Americans.

These individuals represent significant academic and activist contributions to the discourse and practices affecting U.S.-Mexico relations, focusing on creating understanding and cooperation between the two nations.
