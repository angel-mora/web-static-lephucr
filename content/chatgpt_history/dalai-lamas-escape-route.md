How did tibetans escape from Tibet? Provide a map resource to see how they reached India. Video preferably

I found a detailed account of the Dalai Lama's escape from Tibet to India on [The Better India](8), which describes his perilous journey through the Himalayas, including crossing the Brahmaputra river and evading Chinese forces. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a video or a map detailing the exact route in my current resources. For a more visual representation of the escape route, you may need to search through video platforms or specialized map services which can provide historical routes or documentaries that might include the map you're looking for.

Trace some coordinates that I can put in kepler.gl. Provide csv compliant

I have located a source that mentions the escape route of His Holiness the Dalai Lama as illustrated in his memoir, "My Land and My People." However, the source from the Tibet Museum does not provide specific geographic coordinates or a downloadable CSV format for Kepler.gl visualization„Äê20‚Ä†source„Äë.

For a more comprehensive search, you might need to access detailed historical texts or databases that could provide such data. Currently, within the confines of the tools available to me, I am unable to extract or trace exact geographic coordinates that would be compliant with CSV format for mapping software. You may consider consulting academic resources or historical databases that specialize in such geographic information.

Provide coordinates based on teemptative locations (searching coords from google maps)

The attempt to retrieve coordinates programmatically was unsuccessful due to the lack of internet access required to query an external geocoding service. However, I can guide you on how to obtain the coordinates manually:

1. **Lhasa, Tibet**: The starting point of the Dalai Lama's escape. You can find the coordinates of Lhasa by searching for "Lhasa, Tibet" on Google Maps.
   
2. **Norbulingka, Lhasa, Tibet**: This is the summer palace from where the Dalai Lama started his escape. Search for "Norbulingka, Lhasa, Tibet" to get the coordinates.

3. **Brahmaputra River near Lhasa, Tibet**: For the crossing point of the Brahmaputra River, you may need to refer to historical accounts to pinpoint a more precise location near Lhasa, then use Google Maps for coordinates.

4. **Lhuntse Dzong, Tibet**: A significant point near the end of the escape before reaching the Indian border. Look up "Lhuntse Dzong, Tibet" on the map for its coordinates.

5. **Chuthangmu, India**: The entry point into India. You can find Chuthangmu by searching for it on Google Maps to obtain the coordinates.

6. **Mussoorie, India**: Where the Central Tibetan Administration was first established. "Mussoorie, India" can be searched on Google Maps.

7. **Dharamshala, India**: The current location of the Central Tibetan Administration. Search for "Dharamshala, India" to find the coordinates.

Once you have all the coordinates, you can create a CSV file with this structure:

```
Location, Latitude, Longitude
Lhasa, [Latitude], [Longitude]
Norbulingka, [Latitude], [Longitude]
...
```

Replace `[Latitude]` and `[Longitude]` with the actual coordinates you find. This CSV can then be uploaded to kepler.gl for visualization.
