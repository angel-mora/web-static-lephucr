algebraic ecuation resolution. Provide a good example with 3 variables. I haven't see this since 8 years ago so please be pedagogic. You can use latex notation

Sure, I'll provide an example of solving a system of linear equations with three variables. This is a common type of algebraic equation in mathematics. We often represent these equations in the form \( ax + by + cz = d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are constants, and \( x, y, \) and \( z \) are the variables we need to solve for.

### Example Problem

Let's consider the following system of equations:

1. \( 2x + 3y - z = 7 \)
2. \( -x + 4y + 2z = 4 \)
3. \( 3x - y + z = -6 \)

### Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Choose Two Equations to Eliminate One Variable**

First, we choose two equations from the set and find a way to eliminate one of the variables. Let's take the first two equations and eliminate \( z \). We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second by 1, then adding them together:

- \( 4x + 6y - 2z = 14 \)
- \( -x + 4y + 2z = 4 \)

Adding these equations, we get:

- \( 3x + 10y = 18 \) (Equation 4)

**Step 2: Choose Another Pair of Equations to Eliminate the Same Variable**

Now, we take another pair of equations, say the first and the third, and again eliminate \( z \). We can multiply the first equation by 1 and the third by 1, then add them:

- \( 2x + 3y - z = 7 \)
- \( 3x - y + z = -6 \)

Adding these equations, we get:

- \( 5x + 2y = 1 \) (Equation 5)

**Step 3: Solve the Two-variable System**

Now we have a two-variable system (Equation 4 and Equation 5). Let's solve this system:

From Equation 4: \( 3x + 10y = 18 \)
From Equation 5: \( 5x + 2y = 1 \)

We can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply Equation 5 by 5 and Equation 4 by 2, then subtract:

- \( 25x + 10y = 5 \)
- \( 6x + 20y = 36 \)

Subtracting these equations, we get:

- \( 19x = -31 \)
- \( x = -\frac{31}{19} \)

**Step 4: Find the Other Variables**

Now that we have \( x \), we can substitute this value into Equation 4 or 5 to find \( y \). Let's use Equation 5:

- \( 5(-\frac{31}{19}) + 2y = 1 \)
- Solve for \( y \)

Once \( y \) is found, substitute \( x \) and \( y \) into one of the original equations to find \( z \).

### Conclusion

This process of elimination and substitution is a fundamental approach to solving systems of linear equations. By systematically eliminating variables and solving the resulting simpler equations, you can find the values of all variables.
