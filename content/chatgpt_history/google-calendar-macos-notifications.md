🙋 **You:**

latest macos not showing google calendar notifications but only sounds

🤖 **Assistant:**

If your macOS is playing sound for Google Calendar notifications but not showing the actual notification banners, here are several steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

---

### **1. Check macOS Notification Settings**
Ensure that notifications for your browser or Google Calendar are correctly configured:

- Go to **System Settings** > **Notifications**.
- Find the browser you're using for Google Calendar (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) in the list.
- Make sure **Allow Notifications** is enabled.
- Ensure **Alerts** or **Banners** are selected (not just "Sound").
- Toggle **Show in Notification Center** and **Badge App Icon** on.
- Ensure **Play sound for notifications** is also enabled.

---

### **2. Verify Calendar App Notification Settings**
If you use the built-in macOS Calendar app (synced with Google Calendar), make sure its notifications are enabled:

- Open the **Calendar** app.
- Go to **Calendar** > **Settings** > **Alerts**.
- Ensure alert settings for events are set correctly (e.g., "At time of event").
  
---

### **3. Check Google Calendar Settings**
If you're using Google Calendar through a browser:

- Open **Google Calendar** in your browser.
- Click the gear icon (**⚙️ Settings**) > **Settings**.
- Go to **Event Settings** and ensure that "Notifications" is selected under "Event notifications".
- Scroll down to **Browser Notifications** and ensure it says "Notifications are enabled".
  - If not, click the **Enable notifications** button.

---

### **4. Clear Browser Cache & Cookies**
Sometimes cached data or cookies may interfere with notifications:

- In your browser, clear the cache and cookies for Google Calendar.
- Restart the browser and check if the notifications appear correctly.

---

### **5. Grant Notification Permissions in Browser**
Check whether your browser is allowed to send notifications:

- In Chrome:
  1. Go to **chrome://settings/content/notifications**.
  2. Make sure Google Calendar (or the relevant website) is listed under "Allowed to send notifications".
  
- In Safari:
  1. Go to **Safari** > **Settings** > **Websites** > **Notifications**.
  2. Ensure Google Calendar is set to "Allow".

---

### **6. Disable Focus Mode or Do Not Disturb**
macOS Focus Mode (formerly "Do Not Disturb") can suppress notifications:

- Go to **Control Center** in the top-right corner.
- Ensure **Focus** or **Do Not Disturb** is not enabled.
- You can also check and manage Focus modes in **System Settings** > **Focus**.

---

### **7. Check for Software Updates**
Ensure your macOS and browser are up to date:

- Go to **System Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**.
- Update to the latest macOS version if available.
- Update your browser to the latest version.

---

### **8. Restart macOS**
Sometimes a simple restart can resolve notification issues.

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you're not receiving Google Calendar notifications on your iPhone, here are several steps to help troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Enable Notifications for Google Calendar**
Make sure notifications are enabled for the Google Calendar app:

1. **Go to Settings** > **Notifications**.
2. Scroll down to **Google Calendar** and tap it.
3. Ensure **Allow Notifications** is turned on.
4. Under **Alerts**, enable **Lock Screen**, **Notification Center**, and **Banners**.

2. Tap the **Menu icon (three horizontal lines)** in the top-left corner.

4. Select one of your calendars (e.g., your main email calendar).
5. Tap **Notifications** and ensure event notifications are enabled for **All Day Events**, **Events**, and **Reminders**.
6. Repeat this for any other calendars you want notifications for.

---

### **3. Ensure Background App Refresh is Enabled**
Google Calendar needs to refresh in the background to send timely notifications.

1. **Go to Settings** > **General** > **Background App Refresh**.
2. Ensure **Background App Refresh** is turned on (either for Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi & Cellular Data).
3. Scroll down and make sure **Google Calendar** is toggled on.

Focus mode or Do Not Disturb can block notifications:

2. Check if **Focus** or **Do Not Disturb** is enabled. If it is, tap it to disable.
3. Alternatively, go to **Settings** > **Focus** and ensure Google Calendar notifications are allowed during active Focus modes.

3. Go back to **Settings** > **Calendar** > **Default Alert Times** and set appropriate alerts for events.

2. Tap your **Google account**.
3. Ensure **Calendars** is toggled on.

2. Tap your profile icon in the top-right corner.
