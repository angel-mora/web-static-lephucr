Give me a list of catchy names for my knowledge base based social network. It's like Links' navi fairy in the legend of zelda. I am attempting to buy a domain for my mvp for ycombinator

Certainly! Naming your project is an exciting step. Here are some catchy names inspired by the concept of a knowledge base and the Navi fairy from The Legend of Zelda:

1. NaviNet
2. KnowNavi
3. WisdomWisp
4. LinkLore
5. NaviNest
6. LoreLinker
7. WisdomWing
8. InfoFairy
9. KnowFairy
10. NaviNode
11. LinkLumina
12. LoreLuminary
13. NaviNexus
14. WispWeb
15. FairyFount
16. LinkLantern
17. NaviNook
18. WisdomWhisper
19. LoreLantern
20. NaviNetwork
21. LinkLoom
22. FairyForum
23. NaviNestle
24. WisdomWave
25. LinkLodge

Remember to check the availability of the domain names before making a decision. It's also a good idea to ensure that the name resonates with your target audience and aligns with the core values and features of your social network. Good luck with your MVP and Y Combinator application!

KnowNavi sounds appealing. What domain should it be part of? Remember, name + domain should make a catchy and memorable url

Great choice! "KnowNavi" is catchy and memorable. Here are some domain suggestions to pair with it:

1. KnowNavi.com
2. KnowNavi.net
3. KnowNavi.co
4. KnowNavi.app (especially if it's going to be an app-based platform)
5. KnowNavi.io (popular for tech startups)
6. KnowNavi.org (if it's more of a community or non-profit initiative)
7. KnowNavi.link
8. KnowNavi.zone
9. KnowNavi.club
10. KnowNavi.guide

Of these, the ".com" domain is the most universally recognized and trusted. However, if it's taken or too expensive, ".co", ".app", and ".io" are popular alternatives for startups. 

Once you've shortlisted a few, it's a good idea to check their availability. If your preferred choice is taken, you can also consider reaching out to the domain owner for a potential purchase or look for variations.

Knowledge Base Management and Social Networks
Manage and publish your content from within your knowledge base
This ideas was born from my desire to own all my content in a single source of truth and being able to share the product of my ideas associated and processed over my knowledge base. I want to leverage the level of the content I consume and share to my friends to something worth referencing.
Current solutions offer either local processing of your notes or remote markdown wikis management, but any of them offers a rich and pleasurable experience for reading and creating content.
I have a first mover advantage because there nothing like this in the market yet. My startup aims to create a brand new industry: Knowledge Base Networking. An uncharted territory that opens a groundbreaking paradigm for sharing and creating content.
Features: 1) Push content from your local knowledge base to your friends' feed, 2) Navi, your favorite digital fairy, will organize your notes acording to a methodology that suits you the best, 3) Navi also helps you import and organize your notes.
Following agile methodologies, I have created a sales funnel based on a website that will transform your bookmarks into markdown articles that reference them as tags, which will go live in the following six weeks.
I envision navi as the new way to interact with yourself and with others.

Thank you for providing the details, Angel. Here's a customized script for your 1-minute Y Combinator founder introduction video:
