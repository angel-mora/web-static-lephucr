# Rails App Unix Permissions

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Can I create a ruby on rails web application that syncs unix permissions of the client computer?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

In general, it's not advisable nor possible to directly interact with a client's local system's UNIX permissions from a web application for security reasons. This would represent a significant breach of security and privacy. 

A web application built with Ruby on Rails or any other server-side technology cannot interact with the file system of the client (user's computer), because it runs on the server and can only interact with the server-side resources. The client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is executed on the user's browser, which provides a sandboxed environment. This environment restricts the script from accessing system resources for security reasons. 

In the interest of cybersecurity, web browsers and their respective JavaScript engines have strict security models that prevent this kind of direct interaction. If this were possible, it would open up the potential for severe malicious activities, including but not limited to data theft, privacy invasion, and malicious system modifications.

However, if you have a use case that requires managing file permissions, you can do that on the server side. For instance, when a file is uploaded to the server, you can manage its permissions according to your needs. If you need to manage UNIX permissions on the client's computer, this would need to be done through some form of client-side software, not a web application, and with explicit permission from the user.
  
If you want to control UNIX permissions on a remote machine, usually it's done via SSH or other remote access tools, but this should only be done in an environment where you have the proper authorizations and permissions, such as managing your own servers in a cloud environment or managing systems in a corporate intranet where the necessary permissions and safeguards are in place. 

Remember, any actions taken should respect user privacy and security considerations.

So I couldn't create a web application that updates a user local Obsidian-based knowledge base to a web client and pulls data into it?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Interacting directly with a user's local file system from a web application due to the same security constraints explained before is still not possible. The web app cannot directly read or write files from the user's local machine.

However, a functionality like the one you're describing (updating a local Obsidian knowledge base and pulling data into it) could be implemented with user's cooperation and proper security considerations.

Obsidian stores its data in local markdown files. These files can be synced with a server using a variety of methods. Here is a possible workflow:

1. The user manually uploads the local markdown files to your web application. The web application could then process these files, updating the knowledge base on the server-side.

2. Alternatively, you can write a separate client-side application (like a desktop application or a script) that the user would install on their computer. This application could have access to the local file system and could automatically sync markdown files with your server.

3. After processing the markdown files on the server, you could provide a download feature so that the user can download the updated markdown files and replace their local files with the updated ones. Again, this could also be automated with a client-side application if necessary.

4. If the user uses a cloud storage service (like Dropbox or Google Drive) to store their Obsidian files, you could use the cloud service's API to access and update the files. This would still require the user's permission, but wouldn't require direct access to the user's local file system.

In all these cases, the key is that the user is the one giving you access to their files, either by manually uploading and downloading them, or by installing a client-side application that you provide. The web application itself still cannot directly access the local file system.

It's crucial to respect user privacy and security throughout this process. Users should be aware of what data is being transferred, why it's necessary, and how it's being used and stored. Any client-side application should be secure and should only access the necessary files.
