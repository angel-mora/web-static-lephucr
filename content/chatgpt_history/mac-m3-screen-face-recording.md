How big a QuickTime screen and face recording can get for 2 hours sessions

The size of a QuickTime screen and face recording for a 2-hour session can vary significantly depending on several factors:

1. **Screen Resolution**: Higher screen resolutions capture more detail and therefore produce larger file sizes.
2. **Face Camera Quality**: The resolution and quality of the camera used for the face recording will also impact the file size. Higher resolution cameras produce larger files.
3. **Frame Rate**: Videos recorded at higher frame rates (more frames per second) will be larger than those recorded at lower frame rates.
4. **Compression**: QuickTime uses compression to

How big a QuickTime screen and face recording can get for 2 hours sessions for a Mac M3



The file size of a 2-hour QuickTime screen and face recording on a Mac (regardless of model, including an M3 if that were a hypothetical future chip) depends on several factors including the screen resolution, the codec used for encoding (H.264 or HEVC/H.265), the complexity of the screen content, and whether audio is included.

To give a rough estimate, I'll consider a few common scenarios:

1. **Screen Recording with H.264 Encoding**: QuickTime typically uses H.264 for screen recordings. This codec offers a good balance between compression and quality. For a 1080p (Full HD) screen recording with moderate movement and complexity, the bitrate might range from 10 to 20 Mbps. Including audio would add a small amount, typically less than 1 Mbps to the overall bitrate.

2. **Screen Recording with HEVC (H.265) Encoding**: HEVC is more efficient than H.264, allowing for smaller file sizes at equivalent quality levels. However, it's more computationally intensive. Assuming similar conditions to the H.264 scenario but with the more efficient HEVC encoding, the bitrate might range from 5 to 10 Mbps.

3. **Including Face Recording**: Adding a face recording, especially if it's picture-in-picture over a screen recording, will increase the file size. The exact increase depends on the resolution of the face recording and its complexity. Assuming a small window overlay and a standard webcam resolution, the additional bitrate might be relatively modest, likely adding an additional 1-3 Mbps to the overall bitrate.

Let's calculate the file sizes for a 2-hour recording under these conditions, keeping in mind these are rough estimates:

- **Scenario 1 (H.264, 1080p Screen Recording)**: Assuming an average bitrate of 15 Mbps.
- **Scenario 2 (HEVC, 1080p Screen Recording)**: Assuming an average bitrate of 7.5 Mbps.
- **Scenario 3 (HEVC, 1080p Screen + Face Recording)**: Adding an extra 2 Mbps for the face recording to the HEVC scenario.

The formula to calculate file size is: 

\[ \text{File Size (in MB)} = \frac{\text{Bitrate (in Mbps)} \times \text{Time (in seconds)}}{8} \]

Let's do the calculations.

Based on the calculations:

- For a **2-hour screen recording using H.264 encoding** at 1080p resolution, you can expect a file size of approximately **13,500 MB (or 13.5 GB)**.
- For the same recording but **using HEVC (H.265) encoding**, the file size is about **6,750 MB (or 6.75 GB)**.
- If you **include a face recording** with the HEVC-encoded screen recording, the estimated file size goes up to approximately **8,550 MB (or 8.55 GB)**.

These estimates serve as a general guideline, but actual file sizes can vary based on the specifics of the content being recorded, such as the complexity of the visuals and the encoding settings used.
