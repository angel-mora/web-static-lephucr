There are several popular YouTube downloaders written in Python that you can use. Here are a few of the most notable ones:

1. **pytube**:
   - **Description**: `pytube` is a lightweight, dependency-free library that is very popular for downloading YouTube videos. It is simple to use and can download videos in various resolutions.
   - **Installation**: `pip install pytube`
   - **Usage**:

     yt = YouTube('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id')
     stream = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()
     stream.download()
     ```

2. **youtube-dl**:
   - **Description**: `youtube-dl` is a command-line tool that can be used in Python via the subprocess module. It's extremely powerful and supports downloading from many different websites, not just YouTube.
   - **Installation**: `pip install youtube_dl`
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     import youtube_dl

     ydl_opts = {}
     with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
         ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id'])

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Is there anything like that for Spotify?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, there are Python tools similar to YouTube downloaders that work with Spotify. However, it's important to note that directly downloading or ripping content from Spotify may violate Spotify's terms of service and copyright laws, depending on how you use the downloaded content.

That said, here are some Python-based tools that interact with Spotify:

### 1. **spotDL**:
   - **Description**: `spotDL` is a popular tool that can download Spotify songs by searching for them on YouTube and downloading the corresponding video or audio. It then matches the downloaded track's metadata with Spotify's information.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install spotdl
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     # Download a song from Spotify
     subprocess.run(["spotdl", "https://open.spotify.com/track/your_track_id"])
     ```

   - **Note**: `spotDL` works by matching Spotify songs with YouTube videos, so it may not always find the exact track.

### 2. **Spotify Downloader (spotify-downloader)**:
   - **Description**: This tool allows you to download songs from Spotify using YouTube as a source, similar to `spotDL`. It's a command-line tool but can be easily integrated into Python scripts.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     pip install spotify-downloader
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     # Download a playlist or song
     subprocess.run(["spotify-downloader", "https://open.spotify.com/track/your_track_id_or_playlist"])
     ```

### 3. **pytify** (Spotify playback only):
   - **Description**: `pytify` is a tool that controls Spotify playback from the terminal using the Spotify Web API. It doesnâ€™t download songs but can be used to control playback and get metadata.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     pip install pytify
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from pytifylib import Pytify

     pytify = Pytify()
     pytify.search('song name')
     pytify.play()
     ```

### Considerations:
- These tools typically rely on YouTube or other platforms to provide the actual audio content, rather than directly downloading from Spotify.
- Using these tools should be done with an understanding of the legal and ethical implications, particularly regarding copyright.

If you're looking for Spotify tools that respect the platform's API and terms of service, the Spotify Web API is a better option, though it won't let you download music. Instead, it provides access to metadata, playlists, and user data for legal use cases like creating playlists or music analysis tools.
