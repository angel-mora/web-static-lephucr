ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If you're looking for a browser extension or plugin similar to OneTab but with more features, there are several options available. Here are some popular alternatives that offer a variety of features, including sorting by domain, history analytics, and more:

1. **Toby**: This is a popular tab management extension that allows you to organize your tabs into collections. It offers a visual interface where you can drag and drop tabs into different collections. It doesn't have history analytics, but it's a robust tool for tab organization.

2. **Session Buddy**: This extension not only lets you save and restore session tabs but also provides a way to organize them. It has a search feature and can help you manage a large number of tabs. It doesn't offer history analytics, but it's great for session management.

3. **Workona**: This is a more comprehensive workspace manager. It helps you organize tabs, but it also integrates with cloud apps and offers a way to switch between different work contexts easily. It's more than just a tab manager.

4. **Tab Wrangler**: This extension automatically closes inactive tabs and saves them in a list, so you can easily reopen them. It's useful if you often find yourself with too many open tabs. It also has some basic sorting features.

5. **Tabs Outliner**: This is a more advanced tab management tool. It presents your tabs in a tree structure, allowing for a hierarchical organization. It's great if you're working on multiple projects or topics simultaneously.

6. **History Search**: While not a tab manager, this extension focuses on history analytics. It allows you to find any webpage you've visited by searching for keywords. It's a powerful tool if you often find yourself trying to locate a page you've previously visited.

If none of these options provide the exact features you're looking for, you might consider using a combination of extensions. For example, you could use Toby or Session Buddy for tab management and History Search for history analytics.

Lastly, if you're technically inclined, you could also consider creating your own browser extension tailored to your specific needs. There are many resources and tutorials available online to help you get started with browser extension development.

is workona open source?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

No, as of my last update in January 2022, Workona is not open source. It's a commercial product with both free and premium tiers. If you're specifically looking for open-source solutions, you might need to explore other options or consider building a custom solution based on your requirements. Always remember to check the official website or repositories of tools and applications for the most up-to-date information.
