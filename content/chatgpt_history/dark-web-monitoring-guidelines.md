I am a security white hat and got asked to monitor dark net looking for my client db leaked so I can inform proper authorities about it. Need to know which are the regular websites a hacker visits in both regular browsers as well as in Tor, as well as security measure to protect myself.

Monitoring the dark web and tracking down potential data breaches is a responsible task. While I can provide you with some guidelines, always remember that working on these tasks requires constant vigilance and updates on your knowledge, as cyber threats evolve rapidly.

1. **Common Places Hackers Visit**:

    **Regular Web**:
    - Hacking forums: These are regular websites where hackers discuss methods, share tools, etc.
    - Pastebin and similar sites: Data dumps or credentials are occasionally dumped here.
    - GitHub: Some hackers may store their tools, exploits, and codes here.

    **Dark Web (mostly accessed through Tor)**:
    - .onion sites: Specific forums, marketplaces, and boards on the Tor network where illicit activities, including data sales, can happen.
    - Popular dark web marketplaces: Names and URLs change regularly due to takedowns and internal disputes, so you'd need to stay updated.

2. **Security Measures**:

    **General**:
    - Use a VPN: Always protect your identity and location.
    - Use a dedicated machine: Have a separate computer or virtual machine for this purpose.
    - Avoid downloading files or clicking on suspicious links.
    - Regularly update and patch your systems.
    - Backup data regularly and keep backups offline.

    **For Tor**:
    - Use the Tor Browser Bundle: This is a pre-configured browser that protects your anonymity.
    - Modify Tor settings for maximum security and anonymity.
    - Don't use your real name, email, or any personal info.
    - Don't resize the Tor browser window (this can make you more uniquely identifiable).
    - Avoid using HTTP sites on Tor; prefer HTTPS.

    **Communication**:
    - Use encrypted communication platforms for any interaction. 
    - If you have to sign up for something, use anonymous email services and pseudonyms.
    
3. **Stay Updated**:
    - Participate in cybersecurity forums and platforms like NetSec, StackExchange's Information Security, etc.
    - Regularly read about recent data breaches, attacks, and threats.

4. **Legal Considerations**:
    - Always ensure that you're acting within the law. Browsing the dark web isn't illegal, but many activities associated with it can be.
    - Inform local law enforcement about your activities, if required.
    - If you stumble upon extremely sensitive or harmful information, report it immediately to the proper authorities.

Lastly, always remember that while this knowledge provides a foundation, cyber threats and the landscape change quickly. Constantly update your knowledge and tools to stay safe.

Provide actual urls

Sorry, but I cannot provide URLs to potentially harmful or illicit websites, even for legitimate reasons. This is a security and ethical stance to prevent misuse. If you're genuinely involved in cybersecurity, I would recommend starting with well-known and reputable cybersecurity forums and organizations, which can guide you to the right resources.

However, I can provide some URLs for legitimate security resources:

1. **Forums and Communities**:
    - [NetSec on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/)
    - [StackExchange's Information Security](https://security.stackexchange.com/)
    - [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/)

2. **Data Breach Information**:
    - [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
    
3. **Threat Intelligence Platforms**:
    - [AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange (OTX)](https://otx.alienvault.com/)

Again, always ensure you're acting within ethical and legal boundaries. If you're actively monitoring the dark web for clients, ensure you have legal authorization and you're following best practices. If you're unsure about a specific action or resource, consult with peers or legal counsel.
