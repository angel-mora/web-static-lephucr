Remember, understanding and mastering personal finance is a journey that involves both learning and practice. While these books offer valuable insights, it's also important to stay updated with the latest financial trends and strategies.

Summary of the 4 hour workweek

"The 4-Hour Workweek" by Tim Ferriss is a guide to escaping the traditional nine-to-five grind, optimizing work-life balance, and living more efficiently. 

Here's a brief summary of its main ideas:

1. **Time and mobility are the currency of the New Rich**: The central idea is to prioritize time and mobility over material wealth. This can be achieved by transitioning from being an employee to being an entrepreneur or business owner, or by automating income streams to generate passive income.

2. **Deal with information selectively**: Ferriss promotes the concept of a "low-information diet", which means consuming only the information that is necessary and beneficial. 

3. **Outsourcing and Automation**: The book suggests hiring virtual assistants and using automation tools to handle tedious tasks. The goal is to outsource non-critical business tasks, which will free up your time.

4. **The 80/20 Principle**: Ferriss applies the Pareto Principle to many aspects of life. He suggests that 80% of outputs result from 20% of inputs. Consequently, the aim is to identify and focus on those 20% of tasks that lead to the most significant results.

5. **Mini-Retirements**: Instead of saving up for retirement at the end of your career, Ferriss advocates for taking several "mini-retirements" throughout your life. This includes traveling, pursuing hobbies, and learning new skills during these periods.

Overall, "The 4-Hour Workweek" promotes a lifestyle that maximizes personal freedom and self-determination. It challenges traditional views of work and career and provides unconventional strategies to achieve an optimal work-life balance.

And how about the book be your own bank? Is that a good one?

As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, I don't have specific information about a book titled "Be Your Own Bank." There might be a book with this title that has been published after my last training update. However, the concept of being your own bank typically refers to managing your own money effectively, often tied into ideas around cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.

The concept implies taking full control of your financial matters - from transactions, savings, investments, to loans. This often means using financial tools, learning about personal finance management, investments, real estate, and often, it's associated with using decentralized financial tools like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

If the book "Be Your Own Bank" deals with these subjects and comes from a reputable author, it might provide valuable insights into how you can manage your own finances more effectively and take advantage of new financial technologies. As with any financial advice, it's important to evaluate the information critically and consider seeking advice from financial professionals.
