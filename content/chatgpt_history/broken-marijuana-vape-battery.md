My disposable marijuana vape crashed the floor, is it possible the battery broke or is it still safe to smoke it?

If your disposable marijuana vape has crashed on the floor, it is possible that the battery could have been damaged. Lithium-ion batteries, which are commonly used in vape pens, can be damaged by impact, and a damaged battery can be dangerous. 

For your safety, it is best not to use the vape pen if you suspect the battery may be damaged. It's better to dispose of it properly and get a new one. Do not attempt to open or repair the vape pen yourself as this can be dangerous.

If you are concerned about the battery or have any doubts about the safety of the vape pen, you can contact the manufacturer or the retailer where you purchased it to seek their advice or assistance. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to using electronic devices that contain lithium-ion batteries.

What could be the negative consequences if I smoke it anyway?

If you smoke a vape pen with a damaged battery, there are several potential negative consequences that could occur:

1. Risk of explosion or fire: A damaged lithium-ion battery can potentially explode or catch fire, which can cause serious injury or property damage.

2. Inhaling harmful chemicals: If the vape pen is damaged, it may cause the heating element to malfunction, resulting in the release of harmful chemicals that can be harmful when inhaled.

3. Wasting your money: If the vape pen is not working correctly, you may not get the desired effects from the cannabis oil, and you may be wasting your money.

In general, it is not recommended to use electronic devices with damaged batteries. Lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous when damaged, and it's important to take proper precautions to avoid injury or damage to property. If you suspect that your disposable marijuana vape pen is damaged, it is best to dispose of it properly and purchase a new one.

Is there a way I can know?

It can be difficult to know for sure if a disposable marijuana vape pen is safe to use after it has been dropped on the floor. Here are a few things you can check to help determine if the vape pen is safe:

1. Check for any visible damage: Inspect the vape pen carefully for any cracks, dents, or other visible damage. If you notice any damage, it's best not to use the vape pen.

2. Test the heating element: If you're able to turn on the vape pen, take a few puffs and see if the heating element is working correctly. If the vape pen is not heating up properly or produces a burnt taste, it may be damaged.

3. Check the battery life: If the vape pen battery was low before it was dropped, it may be difficult to determine if the battery has been damaged. However, if the battery was full or close to full, and now it's significantly lower or not working at all, it's likely the battery has been damaged.

If you're unsure if the vape pen is safe to use, it's best to err on the side of caution and dispose of it properly. It's not worth risking your safety to use a damaged vape pen.

Would I feel an effect right away if it had the battery broken?

If the battery is broken, it's possible that you may not feel any effects from the disposable marijuana vape pen right away. The battery is responsible for heating the cannabis oil, and if it's not working correctly, the heating element may not be activated. This can result in the cannabis oil not being vaporized and no effects being felt.

However, it's also possible that the vape pen may still work despite a damaged battery, but there may be other potential risks associated with using it, as I mentioned earlier. Therefore, it's best to be cautious and not use a vape pen that has been dropped on the floor and may have a damaged battery. If you're concerned about the vape pen, it's best to dispose of it properly and purchase a new one to ensure your safety.
