About the quote above, didn't get what you mean with counter in either on its own

The quote you've shared seems to describe a situation involving the categorization and counting of publications within a structured taxonomy, specifically within the context of Human Resources (HR). The taxonomy appears to include multiple categories, some of which may overlap. For example, a publication could fall into both "Culture/Diversity, Equity & Inclusion" and "Culture/Culture" categories.

When the quote mentions "it wouldnâ€™t be counted in either on its own," it suggests that when counting the number of publications in each category, a publication that fits into multiple categories (like the example given) is not counted separately for each individual category. Instead, it seems that such a publication is counted in a way that doesn't simply add one to the count of each category it fits into. This approach is likely taken to avoid double counting the same publication in overlapping categories, which could lead to an inflated overall count.

In simpler terms, if a publication qualifies for two categories within the taxonomy, it doesn't contribute a count of one to each of those categories independently when tallying the total number of publications. The counting method is designed to acknowledge the publication's relevance to multiple categories without mistakenly counting it more than once in the overall statistics. This methodology ensures a more accurate representation of the distribution and frequency of topics covered by the publications in the dataset.
