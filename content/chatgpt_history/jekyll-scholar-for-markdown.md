ðŸ™‹ **You:**

How can I visualize bibtex references within github markdown pages?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

You can visualize BibTeX references within GitHub Markdown pages by using a third-party tool called Jekyll-Scholar. Jekyll-Scholar is a Ruby gem that provides a BibTeX parser and bibliography renderer for Jekyll sites.

To use Jekyll-Scholar in your GitHub Markdown pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Jekyll site or add Jekyll-Scholar to an existing site.
2. In your Markdown page, use the `{% bibliography %}` tag to render your bibliography. You can customize the output by passing parameters to the tag.
3. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
5. Visit your GitHub Pages site to see your rendered bibliography.

Here's an example Markdown page that uses Jekyll-Scholar:

```
---
layout: default
title: My Bibliography
---

# My Bibliography

{% bibliography %}
```

For more information on using Jekyll-Scholar, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Is it possible to do it in the github files themselves and not through a deployed page?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

GitHub Markdown pages do not support rendering BibTeX references natively. However, there are a few workarounds you can use to display your references in GitHub Markdown files.

One option is to use a third-party service like Zotero or Mendeley to generate a citation style language (CSL) file from your BibTeX references. You can then use a tool like `pandoc` to convert your Markdown file to HTML and include the generated CSL file to render your references.

Here's an example command you could use with `pandoc`:

```
pandoc --citeproc --csl=path/to/csl/file.csl --bibliography=path/to/bibtex/file.bib -s input.md -o output.html
```

This command will convert the `input.md` file to HTML, using the `--citeproc` option to enable citation processing, the `--csl` option to specify the path to your generated CSL file, and the `--bibliography` option to specify the path to your BibTeX file. The resulting HTML file, `output.html`, will include your rendered references.

You can then include the HTML output in your GitHub Markdown file using an `<iframe>` tag, like this:

```
<iframe src="path/to/output.html"></iframe>
```

Note that this approach has some limitations, such as the need to manually update the HTML file each time you make changes to your BibTeX references. If you need a more robust solution, you may want to consider using a Jekyll site with Jekyll-Scholar, as described in my previous answer.

If I wanted to use that jekyll scholar library, how could I parse obsidian markdown wikilinks?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Jekyll-Scholar supports parsing BibTeX references from Markdown files, including Markdown files that use Obsidian-style wikilinks. To parse Obsidian wikilinks, you'll need to use a modified version of Jekyll-Scholar that includes a custom parser for Obsidian-style links.

Here's how you can set up Jekyll-Scholar to parse Obsidian wikilinks:

1. Install the modified version of Jekyll-Scholar that includes the Obsidian parser. You can install it using Bundler by adding the following line to your `Gemfile`:

   ```
   gem 'jekyll-scholar', git: 'https://github.com/pzweuj/jekyll-scholar.git', branch: 'obsidian-links'
   ```

   Then run `bundle install` to install the gem.

2. Configure Jekyll-Scholar to use the Obsidian parser. In your `_config.yml` file, add the following lines:

   ```
   scholar:
     bibtex_options:
       parser: obsidian
   ```

   This tells Jekyll-Scholar to use the Obsidian parser instead of the default Markdown parser.

3. Use Obsidian-style wikilinks in your Markdown files. For example, you can include a link to a BibTeX file like this:

   ```
   [My Bibliography](:/path/to/bibliography.bib)
   ```

   The `:/` syntax indicates that this is an Obsidian-style link.

4. Include the bibliography in your Markdown file using the `{% bibliography %}` tag. Jekyll-Scholar will parse the Obsidian-style links and include the specified BibTeX file in your bibliography.

   ```
   {% bibliography %}
   ```

That's it! With these steps, you can use Jekyll-Scholar to parse BibTeX references from your Markdown files, including Obsidian-style wikilinks.

Awesome. In another entry a few days ago, I asked you about Gollum wiki within a Rails app with authentication/authorization. If I had developed that the way you suggested, having a subdomain for each user, how could I do it so it produces a jekyll scholar page from the gollum wiki? My main concerns are how to render Obsidian wikilinks and bibtex.

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If you're using Gollum to manage user-specific wikis within a Rails app, you can set up each user's wiki as a Jekyll site with Jekyll-Scholar to render BibTeX references and Obsidian-style wikilinks.

Here's how you can set up each user's wiki as a Jekyll site with Jekyll-Scholar:

1. Create a new Jekyll site for each user's wiki. You can do this programmatically using the Jekyll API. Here's an example method that creates a new Jekyll site for a given user:

   ```ruby
   require 'jekyll'

   def create_user_site(user)
     site = Jekyll::Site.new(Jekyll.configuration({
       'source' => "/path/to/#{user}/wiki",
       'destination' => "/path/to/#{user}/site"
     }))
     site.process
   end
   ```

   This method creates a new Jekyll site with the user's wiki directory as the source directory, and a destination directory where the site will be generated.

2. Set up Jekyll-Scholar in each user's site. You can install Jekyll-Scholar using Bundler by adding it to the `Gemfile`:

   ```
   gem 'jekyll-scholar'
   ```

   Then run `bundle install` to install the gem.

3. Configure Jekyll-Scholar to use the Obsidian parser. In each user's `_config.yml` file, add the following lines:

   ```
   scholar:
     bibtex_options:
       parser: obsidian
   ```

   This tells Jekyll-Scholar to use the Obsidian parser instead of the default Markdown parser.

4. Copy the user's BibTeX file to their Jekyll site directory. You can do this programmatically using Ruby's `FileUtils` module:

   ```ruby
   require 'fileutils'

   def copy_user_bibtex(user)
     FileUtils.cp("/path/to/#{user}/bibliography.bib", "/path/to/#{user}/wiki/bibliography.bib")
   end
   ```

   This method copies the user's BibTeX file from a shared directory to their Jekyll site directory.

5. Generate the user's Jekyll site. You can do this programmatically using the Jekyll API:

   ```ruby
   def generate_user_site(user)
     site = Jekyll::Site.new(Jekyll.configuration({
       'source' => "/path/to/#{user}/wiki",
       'destination' => "/path/to/#{user}/site"
     }))
     site.process
   end
   ```

   This method generates the user's Jekyll site, which includes the rendered bibliography and any Obsidian-style wikilinks in their Markdown files.

6. Serve the user's Jekyll site from their subdomain. You can use a reverse proxy to map each user's subdomain to their Jekyll site directory. For example, you can use Nginx to map `user.example.com` to `/path/to/user/site`.

With these steps, you can set up each user's Gollum wiki as a Jekyll site with Jekyll-Scholar to render BibTeX references and Obsidian-style wikilinks. You can programmatically create and generate each user's site, and serve it from their subdomain using a reverse proxy.
