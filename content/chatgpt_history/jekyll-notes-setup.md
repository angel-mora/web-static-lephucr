How can I show new the content of https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template ?? Got the proper setup and moved my markdown files and folders into notes but don't know how to access the files or the index of the files



To display and access the content of the **digital-garden-jekyll-template**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Verify Installation**
Ensure the project is properly set up. You should have cloned the repository and run the necessary commands:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This starts the Jekyll server locally. By default, the site is available at `http://localhost:4000`.

---

### 2. **Add Markdown Files to `notes` Folder**
Place your markdown files in the `notes` folder as you've already done. Each file should have a proper front matter block at the top, for example:

```markdown
---
title: My Note Title
---

This is the content of the note.
```

If the front matter is missing, Jekyll may not process the file.

---

### 3. **Access Notes**
The template includes a built-in mechanism to render notes. 

- Open the site in your browser (`http://localhost:4000`).
- You should see the homepage with the default content.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/notes` to view an auto-generated index of all the notes.

---

### 4. **Troubleshooting the Notes Index**
If you donâ€™t see your notes listed:
- **Check the File Extensions:** Ensure the files in the `notes` folder end with `.md`.
- **Inspect `_config.yml`:** Ensure the following line exists to recognize the `notes` folder:
  ```yaml
  collections:
    notes:
      output: true
  ```
- **Rebuild the Site:** Stop and restart the Jekyll server with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to apply changes.

---

### 5. **Customize Indexing**
If you want to customize the way the notes index is displayed:
- Edit the `_layouts/note.html` or `_layouts/default.html` files to adjust individual note pages.
- Modify the `index.html` to change the structure of the homepage.

---

### 6. **Advanced Features**
This template supports bidirectional linking. To take full advantage of it:
- Use `[[note-title]]` syntax in your markdown files to create links between notes.
- The template automatically resolves these links to the correct URLs.

how do i handle routes in jekyll?

In Jekyll, routes are managed indirectly through the file structure, permalink settings, and configuration options in the `_config.yml` file. Unlike traditional frameworks, Jekyll doesn't have a router; instead, it uses conventions and configurations to determine URL paths.

Hereâ€™s how to manage and customize routes in Jekyll:

---

### 1. **Default Routing Based on File Structure**
Jekyll generates routes based on where your files are located in the project directory:
- Files in the root folder (e.g., `about.md`) will be available at `/about.html`.
- Files in subfolders (e.g., `folder/page.md`) will be available at `/folder/page.html`.

If you're using collections (e.g., `_notes`), the route will be prefixed by the collection name by default (e.g., `/notes/my-note.html`).

---

### 2. **Customizing Routes with `permalink`**
You can control individual routes by setting the `permalink` property in the front matter of a file. For example:

```yaml
---
title: About Me
permalink: /about/
---
```

This sets the URL for the file to `/about/`, regardless of its location in the project directory.

---

### 3. **Global Route Customization for Collections**
For collections (like `_notes`), you can define default routing in `_config.yml`. For example:

```yaml
collections:
  notes:
    output: true
    permalink: /notes/:title/
```

This will set the URL for all files in `_notes` to `/notes/<file-name>/`.

---

### 4. **Use the `slug` Front Matter for Custom URLs**
You can define a `slug` in the front matter for more control:

```yaml
---
title: My Custom Page
slug: custom-page
permalink: /custom/:slug/
---
```

The URL will be `/custom/custom-page/`.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Routes with Variables**
You can use the following variables in the `permalink` option:
- `:year`, `:month`, `:day`: The date parts from the file's front matter.
- `:title`: The file name (without extension).
- `:slug`: The `slug` front matter property.
- `:categories`: Categories defined in front matter.

For example:

```yaml
permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:title/
```

This would create routes like `/blog/2024/11/my-article/`.

---

### 6. **Customizing Default Routes for Posts**
For posts in the `_posts` directory, you can set a default permalink in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
permalink: /blog/:title/
```

This will apply to all posts and generate URLs like `/blog/post-title/`.

---

### 7. **Using Redirects for Route Changes**
If you want to change a route but maintain backward compatibility, you can add a redirect:
1. Use the [Jekyll Redirect From plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from).
2. Add a `redirect_from` property in the front matter:

```yaml
---
title: New Page
permalink: /new-page/
redirect_from:
  - /old-page/
  - /another-old-page/
---
```

This will redirect `/old-page/` and `/another-old-page/` to `/new-page/`.

---

### 8. **Customizing Routes for Static Assets**
Static files (like images or PDFs) are routed based on their location in the project directory. To organize them under custom routes:
- Place them in folders like `assets/images/` or `files/`.
- Access them directly with the same path: `/assets/images/photo.jpg`.

---

### 9. **Advanced Routing with Plugins**
If you need more complex routing behavior:
- Use plugins like [jekyll-collections-routing](https://github.com/bbostock/jekyll-collections-routing) for custom route handling.
- Combine plugins like `jekyll-redirect-from` or `jekyll-sitemap` for enhanced navigation.

---

By combining the above techniques, you can customize and control the routes in your Jekyll site to fit your needs. Let me know if you have specific requirements or issues!

I want to create a rails app that allow you to create these digital gardens as tenants, how can I accomplish this goal?

Creating a Rails app that allows users to create and manage their own digital gardens as tenants can be achieved by using a **multitenancy architecture**. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to approach this:

---

### 1. **Define the Multitenancy Architecture**
Multitenancy means each user (or "tenant") has their isolated workspace. You can implement multitenancy using one of these approaches:
1. **Shared Database, Scoped by Tenant:** Use a single database with tenant-specific scoping (e.g., using a `tenant_id` field).
2. **Separate Databases per Tenant:** Each tenant has its own database. Use this for high data isolation or scalability needs.

For simplicity, let's assume youâ€™ll start with the **shared database** approach.

---

### 2. **Set Up the Rails App**
#### Install Rails
Create a new Rails app:
```bash
rails new digital_garden_app
cd digital_garden_app
```

#### Add Necessary Gems
Add the following gems for multitenancy and Markdown support in your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'apartment' # For multitenancy
gem 'kramdown'  # For Markdown rendering
```

Run `bundle install`.

---

### 3. **Implement Multitenancy with Apartment**
#### Install and Configure Apartment
Run the Apartment installer:
```bash
rails generate apartment:install
```

This will generate an initializer (`config/initializers/apartment.rb`). Configure it to use subdomains or another tenant identifier:
```ruby
Apartment.configure do |config|
  config.excluded_models = %w[User] # Models not scoped by tenants
  config.tenant_names = -> { Tenant.pluck(:subdomain) } # Dynamically fetch tenant names
end
```

#### Create a `Tenant` Model
Generate a model for managing tenants:
```bash
rails generate model Tenant name:string subdomain:string:index
```

Run migrations:
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

---

### 4. **Set Up Subdomain Routing**
Update `config/routes.rb` to scope routes by subdomains:
```ruby
constraints subdomain: /.+/ do
  scope module: 'tenants' do
    root to: 'digital_gardens#index'
    # Add other tenant-specific routes here
  end
end
```

Create a `Tenants::DigitalGardensController` to handle tenant-specific logic.

---

### 5. **Integrate Digital Garden Features**
#### Create a `Note` Model
Generate a model for storing digital garden notes:
```bash
rails generate model Note title:string content:text tenant:references
```

Run migrations:
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Ensure the `Note` model belongs to a tenant:
```ruby
class Note < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :tenant
end
```

#### Add Markdown Rendering
Use the `kramdown` gem to render Markdown. In your views:
```erb
<%= Kramdown::Document.new(note.content).to_html.html_safe %>
```

#### Set Up a Basic Interface
Generate controllers and views for notes:
```bash
rails generate scaffold Note title:string content:text
```

Update the `NotesController` to scope by tenant:
```ruby
before_action :set_tenant

def index
  @notes = @tenant.notes
end

private

def set_tenant
  @tenant = Tenant.find_by(subdomain: request.subdomain)
end
```

---

### 6. **Allow Tenants to Create Digital Gardens**
Create a `TenantsController` for managing tenant onboarding:
```bash
rails generate controller Tenants new create
```

In `app/controllers/tenants_controller.rb`:
```ruby
class TenantsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @tenant = Tenant.new
  end

  def create
    @tenant = Tenant.new(tenant_params)
    if @tenant.save
      Apartment::Tenant.create(@tenant.subdomain) # Create tenant schema
      redirect_to root_url(subdomain: @tenant.subdomain)
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def tenant_params
    params.require(:tenant).permit(:name, :subdomain)
  end
end
```

Add a form for tenant creation in `app/views/tenants/new.html.erb`.

---

### 7. **Manage Tenant Isolation**
To ensure isolation:
- Scope all models by the current tenant:
  ```ruby
  default_scope { where(tenant_id: Apartment::Tenant.current) }
  ```
- Use middleware to switch tenants based on subdomains.

---

### 8. **Deploy and Test**
Deploy to a hosting platform that supports subdomains (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or custom VPS) and test by creating tenants and notes.

---

### 9. **Advanced Features**
- **Bidirectional Linking:** Parse `[[note-title]]` in `Note` content to link notes within the same tenant.
- **Customization:** Allow tenants to configure themes and layouts.
- **Export to Static Site:** Add an option to export a digital garden as a Jekyll site or other static site generator.

I dont see how you are connecting the rails app with the jekyll digital garden template

Ah, you're rightâ€”my initial response focused more on building the Rails app with multitenancy, but it didn't address the integration of the Jekyll Digital Garden template directly with the Rails app. Here's how to achieve that connection while allowing tenants to create and manage digital gardens:

---

### **Approach Overview**
The goal is to:
1. Use Rails as the backend for tenant management and content creation.
2. Use Jekyll as the frontend for rendering digital gardens, leveraging its Markdown processing capabilities.
3. Dynamically generate and serve a Jekyll site for each tenant based on the content stored in the Rails app.

---

### **Steps to Integrate Jekyll with Rails**

#### 1. **Prepare the Jekyll Template**
Clone the Jekyll digital garden template (e.g., [maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template
```

Place this template in a directory where your Rails app can access it, such as `lib/jekyll_templates`.

---

#### 2. **Set Up Content Storage in Rails**
Store tenant-specific content in Rails. For example, use a `Note` model scoped by tenant:

```ruby
class Note < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :tenant
  validates :title, :content, presence: true
end
```

Ensure `Tenant` and `Note` are connected:

```ruby
class Tenant < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :notes, dependent: :destroy
end
```

---

#### 3. **Generate Jekyll Files Dynamically**
When a tenant creates or updates content in the Rails app, generate Markdown files in a tenant-specific Jekyll directory.

##### Example Workflow:
- Create a `jekyll_sites` folder in the Rails app:
  ```bash
  mkdir jekyll_sites
  ```

- When a tenant saves a note, write it as a Markdown file in their corresponding Jekyll folder. For example, in `Note`'s `after_save` callback:

```ruby
class Note < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :tenant

  after_save :generate_markdown_file

  def generate_markdown_file
    tenant_dir = Rails.root.join("jekyll_sites", tenant.subdomain)
    Dir.mkdir(tenant_dir) unless Dir.exist?(tenant_dir)

    # Write the Markdown file
    File.open("#{tenant_dir}/#{title.parameterize}.md", 'w') do |file|
      file.write <<~MARKDOWN
        ---
        title: #{title}
        ---
        #{content}
      MARKDOWN
    end
  end
end
```

---

#### 4. **Build Jekyll Site for Each Tenant**
Use the Jekyll CLI to build the tenant's site when changes are made.

- Add a `build_site` method to your `Tenant` model:

```ruby
class Tenant < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :notes

  def build_jekyll_site
    tenant_dir = Rails.root.join("jekyll_sites", subdomain)
    template_dir = Rails.root.join("lib/jekyll_templates/digital-garden")

    # Copy the Jekyll template to the tenant directory
    FileUtils.cp_r(template_dir, tenant_dir) unless Dir.exist?(tenant_dir)

    # Run Jekyll build
    system("jekyll build --source #{tenant_dir} --destination #{tenant_dir}/_site")
  end
end
```

Call `tenant.build_jekyll_site` after a note is saved or deleted.

---

#### 5. **Serve Jekyll Sites**
Use Rails to serve the generated static sites.

- Add a route to handle tenant-specific Jekyll sites:
```ruby
get 'tenants/:subdomain', to: 'tenants#serve_jekyll'
```

- In the `TenantsController`:

```ruby
class TenantsController < ApplicationController
  def serve_jekyll
    tenant = Tenant.find_by!(subdomain: params[:subdomain])
    jekyll_site_path = Rails.root.join("jekyll_sites", tenant.subdomain, "_site")

    unless Dir.exist?(jekyll_site_path)
      tenant.build_jekyll_site
    end

    send_file File.join(jekyll_site_path, 'index.html'), type: 'text/html', disposition: 'inline'
  end
end
```

---

#### 6. **Automate the Workflow**
To streamline the process:
1. Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq) to run the `build_jekyll_site` method asynchronously.
2. Use webhooks or `ActiveSupport::Notifications` to trigger rebuilds when content is updated.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. **Custom Domains for Tenants:**
   Use DNS settings and Rails routing constraints to map custom domains to tenant-specific Jekyll sites.

2. **Dynamic Theme Configuration:**
   Store theme preferences in the `Tenant` model and apply them by modifying the Jekyll template's `_config.yml` during site generation.

3. **Export as Static Files:**
   Provide tenants the option to download their site as a ZIP file for external hosting.

---

With this setup, your Rails app acts as a backend for tenant management and content creation, while Jekyll handles the frontend rendering of digital gardens. This approach keeps the separation of concerns clean and leverages the strengths of both frameworks. Let me know if you'd like code for specific parts of this!

What if I wanted the app to sync with the github repo containing the digital garden? Would it be better to use an approach like Gollum gem for git-based updates?? What would be the simplest approach so I can also edit my knowledge base from my local machine and push the changes?
I am considering maybe having the static content, press a button and switch to an editor.js interface to submit requests to modify the markdown files, as you suggested. However, I am concerned if this would be the ideal approach cause that would mean: 1. render the editor.js ui, 2. save the note in the db, save it to markdown (and then also we need to consider if we are syncing the models from the latest changes coming from the remote git server), compile it, and then we would need to create a service to push it to git. As a Rails scalability architect, provide the most comprehensive consultation

To implement a scalable and user-friendly solution that allows you to manage a digital garden with synchronization to a GitHub repository, we need to balance **scalability**, **simplicity**, and **user experience**. Below is a comprehensive consultation on the architecture and steps you could follow.

---

## **Key Considerations**

1. **Git as the Source of Truth**:
   - If you plan to edit the digital garden both locally and through the app, using Git as the source of truth ensures synchronization and avoids divergence between the database and the repository.

2. **Database vs. Filesystem Storage**:
   - Minimize redundancy. Instead of maintaining a separate database and Markdown files, you could operate directly on the Git repository and Markdown files.
   - Use a database only for caching or indexing purposes (e.g., to speed up search and metadata queries).

3. **Push and Pull to Git**:
   - Changes in the app should commit and push updates to the GitHub repository.
   - Updates to the GitHub repository (e.g., local edits pushed by a user) should trigger a pull to update the app.

4. **Edit Mode**:
   - Implement an editor like `Editor.js` or `Trix` for an inline editing experience.
   - Save changes as Markdown to the Git repository, keeping content management lightweight and straightforward.

5. **Static Site Generation**:
   - Use Jekyll, Gollum, or another static site generator to build the site dynamically from Markdown files.
   - Ensure changes pushed to GitHub rebuild and deploy the site automatically (e.g., using GitHub Actions).

---

## **Proposed Architecture**

Hereâ€™s a scalable and efficient architecture for your app:

1. **Git Repository as Backend Storage**:
   - Use the repository to store Markdown files. Sync changes made through the app with Git (commit and push).
   - When the repository updates, fetch and apply changes locally.

2. **File-based Editor Integration**:
   - Use `Editor.js` or similar for content editing.
   - Save edits directly as Markdown files in the repository, avoiding the need for a complex database layer for notes.

3. **Service Layer for Git Operations**:
   - Implement a service in Rails for handling Git operations (clone, commit, push, pull).
   - Use the `rugged` or `git` gems to interact with Git repositories programmatically.

4. **Trigger Sync from GitHub**:
   - Set up webhooks in the GitHub repository to notify your app of changes.
   - On receiving a webhook, pull the latest updates and rebuild the appâ€™s internal state or static site.

5. **Deployment and Hosting**:
   - Use GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify to serve the static site.
   - Trigger rebuilds via CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).

6. **Optional Caching**:
   - Index metadata from the Markdown files into the database for faster queries (e.g., titles, tags, links).
   - Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq) to keep the index updated after syncs.

---

## **Implementation Details**

### 1. **Git Integration with Rails**
Use the `rugged` gem to manage Git repositories directly in Rails:

```ruby
# Example service for Git operations
class GitService
  REPO_PATH = Rails.root.join('repos', 'digital_garden')

  def initialize(repo_url)
    @repo_url = repo_url
  end

  def clone_repo
    Rugged::Repository.clone_at(@repo_url, REPO_PATH.to_s)
  end

  def commit_and_push(file_path, content, message)
    repo = Rugged::Repository.new(REPO_PATH)
    oid = repo.write(content, :blob)
    index = repo.index
    index.add(path: file_path, oid: oid, mode: 0o100644)
    options = {
      tree: index.write_tree(repo),
      author: { email: "user@example.com", name: "Your Name", time: Time.now },
      committer: { email: "user@example.com", name: "Your Name", time: Time.now },
      message: message,
      parents: [repo.head.target].compact,
      update_ref: 'HEAD'
    }
    Rugged::Commit.create(repo, options)
    repo.push('origin', ['refs/heads/main'])
  end

  def pull_latest
    repo = Rugged::Repository.new(REPO_PATH)
    repo.fetch('origin')
    repo.reset('origin/main', :hard)
  end
end
```

### 2. **Webhooks for Sync**
Set up a GitHub webhook to notify your app of repository changes:
1. Create a webhook in GitHub (e.g., `/webhooks/github`).
2. Handle the webhook in Rails:

```ruby
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def github
    GitService.new('your-repo-url').pull_latest
    head :ok
  end
end
```

### 3. **Editor Integration**
Use `Editor.js` or another editor to provide a rich editing experience. When the user saves:
1. Save the note as a Markdown file in the repository.
2. Commit and push the change using `GitService`.

---

### 4. **Static Site Generation**
Integrate Jekyll or Gollum to build the static site:
1. **Jekyll**:
   - Install Jekyll locally in the repository.
   - Add a rake task to rebuild the site:
     ```ruby
     namespace :jekyll do
       desc "Build Jekyll site"
       task build: :environment do
         system("cd #{GitService::REPO_PATH} && jekyll build")
       end
     end
     ```
   - Trigger this task after each update.

2. **Gollum**:
   - Use the Gollum gem to serve Markdown files dynamically:
     ```ruby
     gem 'gollum'
     ```
   - Mount Gollum in your Rails app:
     ```ruby
     mount Gollum::App, at: "/docs"
     ```

---

### 5. **Push Changes to GitHub**
Create a Rails service for pushing changes to the GitHub repository:

```ruby
class GitHubService
  def self.push_to_repo(file_path, content, message)
    git_service = GitService.new('your-repo-url')
    git_service.commit_and_push(file_path, content, message)
  end
end
```

Trigger this after the user edits a note via the editor interface.

---

### 6. **Optional Features**
- **Search**: Use the Rails database to index Markdown files for searchability.
- **Link Preview**: Implement bidirectional linking by parsing `[[note-title]]` in Markdown files and generating links dynamically.

---

## **Scalability Considerations**

1. **Data Volume**:
   - Keep the repository size manageable by cleaning unused files and rebasing when necessary.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - Handle race conditions when multiple users edit the same file by implementing locking mechanisms or Git conflict resolution workflows.

3. **Performance**:
   - Use background jobs for expensive operations like pulling updates or rebuilding static sites.

4. **Security**:
   - Validate user actions and restrict repository access using OAuth with GitHub or personal access tokens.

---

This architecture is scalable, keeps Git as the source of truth, and allows seamless local editing and web-based management. Let me know if you'd like code examples for specific components!

I want to host the static app, not helping them host it themselves. Now, I want to keep the digital-garden template features, like the wikilinks. I want you to make a choice, that jekyll template or gollum. Think comprehensively

Given your requirementsâ€”to **host the static app yourself**, maintain **wikilink features** from the Digital Garden template, and provide a robust solution for syncing with a Git repositoryâ€”**Gollum** emerges as the better choice. Hereâ€™s why, along with a detailed comparison and implementation plan.

---

### **Why Choose Gollum Over Jekyll for This Use Case?**

1. **Dynamic Markdown Editing:**
   - **Gollum**: Designed for Git-backed wikis with a built-in editor and dynamic updates. Users can edit pages directly through a web UI, and changes are committed to the Git repository automatically.
   - **Jekyll**: Requires static file changes and a build process for every update, which can be slower and less user-friendly.

2. **Wikilink Support:**
   - **Gollum**: Natively supports `[[wikilinks]]` and resolves them dynamically, making it easy to maintain the linking features of the digital garden.
   - **Jekyll**: Wikilinks can be implemented with plugins, but itâ€™s not native. Additional complexity arises if the template needs modification to handle dynamic updates.

3. **Dynamic Hosting:**
   - **Gollum**: Operates like a Rails app, dynamically serving Markdown files with minimal overhead for site updates.
   - **Jekyll**: Requires pre-building and deploying static files, which adds latency for real-time content updates.

4. **Integration with Git:**
   - **Gollum**: Built-in Git integration for commits, pushes, and pulls, simplifying sync with a remote repository.
   - **Jekyll**: Requires external scripts or services (e.g., GitHub Actions) to manage commits and deploys.

5. **Simplicity for Hosting:**
   - **Gollum**: A single, server-side solution that dynamically serves Markdown content.
   - **Jekyll**: Adds complexity with the need to manage a build process and static file serving.

---

### **Proposed Solution with Gollum**

#### **1. Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Use Gollum's built-in UI for editing and viewing Markdown files.
- **Backend**: Rails or Sinatra app to host Gollum, manage users/tenants, and sync with Git repositories.
- **Git Integration**: Use Gollumâ€™s built-in Git functionality to sync with a central GitHub repository.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the app on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean to serve the digital gardens dynamically.

---

#### **2. Implementation Plan**

##### **Step 1: Set Up Gollum**
Add the `gollum` gem to your Rails project:

```ruby
gem 'gollum'
```

Mount Gollum as a Rails engine in your `routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Gollum::App, at: '/wiki'
end
```

This exposes a Gollum-powered wiki interface at `/wiki`.

---

##### **Step 2: Configure Gollum for Multitenancy**
Each tenant should have its own wiki (Git repository). Use a service to manage repositories:

```ruby
class WikiService
  WIKI_BASE_PATH = Rails.root.join('repos')

  def initialize(tenant)
    @tenant = tenant
    @repo_path = WIKI_BASE_PATH.join(@tenant.subdomain)
  end

  def setup_repository
    return if Dir.exist?(@repo_path)

    # Clone or initialize a repository for the tenant
    Rugged::Repository.init_at(@repo_path)
  end

  def commit_changes(file_path, content, message)
    repo = Rugged::Repository.new(@repo_path)
    oid = repo.write(content, :blob)
    index = repo.index
    index.add(path: file_path, oid: oid, mode: 0o100644)
    options = {
      tree: index.write_tree(repo),
      author: { email: "admin@example.com", name: "Admin", time: Time.now },
      committer: { email: "admin@example.com", name: "Admin", time: Time.now },
      message: message,
      parents: [repo.head.target].compact,
      update_ref: 'HEAD'
    }
    Rugged::Commit.create(repo, options)
  end
end
```

---

##### **Step 3: Add Wikilink Features**
Gollum supports `[[wikilinks]]` out of the box. To enhance the experience:
- Add a metadata field for tenants to store custom settings (e.g., themes).
- Use Gollumâ€™s plugins to extend functionality (e.g., backlinks, graph visualization).

---

##### **Step 4: Sync with GitHub**
Enable synchronization between the hosted Gollum instance and a remote GitHub repository:
1. Add a webhook in GitHub to notify the Rails app of changes.
2. Use the `pull_latest` method in your `WikiService` to fetch updates:

```ruby
def pull_latest
  repo = Rugged::Repository.new(@repo_path)
  repo.fetch('origin')
  repo.reset('origin/main', :hard)
end
```

---

##### **Step 5: Deploy the App**
1. Deploy the Rails app (with Gollum) to a hosting platform.
2. Ensure the `repos` folder is writable and accessible on the server.

---

##### **Step 6: Enhance the UI**
1. Replace Gollumâ€™s default editor with `Editor.js` or a custom editor.
2. Submit changes to Gollum via its API or directly modify the Markdown files.

---

#### **3. Optional Features**
1. **Custom Themes**:
   - Allow tenants to select and customize themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
   - Store themes in a `tenant_settings.yml` file or in the database.

2. **Backlink Graphs**:
   - Use `graphviz` or a similar library to render visual backlink graphs for tenants.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Integrate Elasticsearch or a lightweight search library like Lunr.js for full-text search across Markdown files.

4. **API for Automation**:
   - Provide an API endpoint for tenants to automate content updates.

---

### **Why Gollum is Ideal**

- **Dynamic Editing**: Built-in support for editing Markdown files dynamically.
- **Wikilinks**: Native support without requiring complex plugins.
- **Git Integration**: Seamless sync with GitHub repositories.
- **Simplicity**: No need for a separate build or deployment process.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to enhance with Rails or Sinatra.

If youâ€™re prioritizing dynamic content management and hosting over static site generation, **Gollum is the better fit**. It keeps your architecture lean and scalable while offering a rich feature set for your digital gardens. Let me know if you'd like further assistance implementing this!

Now provide a detailed implementation for a Rails app that serves multiple gollum-based tenants. Use GitHub as login and repo source

Creating a **Rails app that serves multiple tenants using Gollum and GitHub for authentication and as a repository source** involves several steps. Below is a detailed implementation:

---

## **Step 1: Set Up the Rails App**

Create a new Rails application:

```bash
rails new gollum_tenants_app --database=postgresql
cd gollum_tenants_app
```

### Install Required Gems

Add these gems to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'gollum'          # Core Gollum functionality
gem 'omniauth-github' # For GitHub authentication
gem 'omniauth'        # Omniauth integration
gem 'octokit'         # GitHub API client
gem 'devise'          # User authentication
gem 'pg'              # PostgreSQL for multitenancy
gem 'pundit'          # Authorization
```

Run:

```bash
bundle install
```

---

## **Step 2: Set Up Devise for Authentication**

Install Devise and configure it for GitHub login:

```bash
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
```

### Configure GitHub OAuth

Add the following to `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  config.omniauth :github, ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'user,repo'
end
```

Create `.env` to store GitHub secrets:

```bash
echo "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id" >> .env
echo "GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret" >> .env
```

### Update User Model for Omniauth

In `app/models/user.rb`:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :omniauthable, omniauth_providers: [:github]

  def self.from_omniauth(auth)
    where(provider: auth.provider, uid: auth.uid).first_or_create do |user|
      user.email = auth.info.email
      user.name = auth.info.name
      user.github_token = auth.credentials.token
    end
  end
end
```

Create the columns for `provider`, `uid`, and `github_token` in a migration:

```bash
rails generate migration AddOmniauthToUsers provider:string uid:string github_token:string
rails db:migrate
```

### Add Omniauth Callbacks Controller

In `app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def github
    @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
    if @user.persisted?
      sign_in_and_redirect @user, event: :authentication
    else
      redirect_to root_path, alert: "Failed to authenticate with GitHub."
    end
  end
end
```

Update `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
devise_for :users, controllers: { omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks' }
```

---

## **Step 3: Create Tenant Model and Git Integration**

### Tenant Model

Generate the `Tenant` model:

```bash
rails generate model Tenant name:string subdomain:string:index owner:references
```

In `app/models/tenant.rb`:

```ruby
class Tenant < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :owner, class_name: "User"
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, through: :memberships

  validates :name, :subdomain, presence: true
end
```

### Membership Model

Generate the `Membership` model for user-tenant associations:

```bash
rails generate model Membership user:references tenant:references role:string
```

In `app/models/membership.rb`:

```ruby
class Membership < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :tenant

  validates :role, inclusion: { in: %w[owner editor viewer] }
end
```

---

## **Step 4: GitHub Repository Integration**

### Octokit Client Setup

Use Octokit to interact with GitHub repositories. In `app/services/github_service.rb`:

```ruby
class GithubService
  def initialize(user)
    @client = Octokit::Client.new(access_token: user.github_token)
  end

  def list_repos
    @client.repos
  end

  def create_repo(repo_name)
    @client.create_repository(repo_name)
  end

  def add_collaborator(repo_name, collaborator_username)
    @client.add_collaborator(repo_name, collaborator_username)
  end

  def clone_repo(repo_url, local_path)
    system("git clone #{repo_url} #{local_path}")
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 5: Set Up Gollum for Tenant Wikis**

### Directory Structure

Store tenant-specific repositories in a centralized directory (e.g., `repos/`):

```bash
mkdir repos
```

### Gollum Mounting

Mount Gollum dynamically for each tenant. Update `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
constraints subdomain: /.+/ do
  mount -> { Gollum::App.new(settings: { gollum_path: Rails.root.join("repos", request.subdomain) }) }, at: '/'
end
```

---

## **Step 6: Tenant Management**

### Tenant Controller

Create a `TenantsController` for managing tenants:

```bash
rails generate controller Tenants new create index
```

In `app/controllers/tenants_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class TenantsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def index
    @tenants = current_user.tenants
  end

  def new
    @tenant = Tenant.new
  end

  def create
    @tenant = current_user.tenants.build(tenant_params)
    if @tenant.save
      GithubService.new(current_user).create_repo(@tenant.subdomain)
      redirect_to tenants_path, notice: "Tenant created and repository initialized!"
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def tenant_params
    params.require(:tenant).permit(:name, :subdomain)
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 7: Sync Changes Between Gollum and GitHub**

### Commit and Push Updates

When editing a Gollum wiki, use the post-save hook to commit changes:

```ruby
class GollumWiki
  def self.sync_changes(repo_path)
    system("cd #{repo_path} && git add . && git commit -m 'Sync changes' && git push")
  end
end
```

### Pull Updates

Set up a webhook in GitHub to notify the app of repository changes:

```ruby
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def github
    payload = JSON.parse(request.body.read)
    tenant = Tenant.find_by(subdomain: payload["repository"]["name"])
    repo_path = Rails.root.join("repos", tenant.subdomain)

    GollumWiki.sync_changes(repo_path) if tenant
    head :ok
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 8: Hosting and Deployment**

- Use **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean** to deploy the app.
- Ensure the `repos/` directory is writable.
- Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq) for pulling updates from GitHub and syncing changes.

---

## **Optional Features**

1. **Wikilink Support**:
   - Enable backlinks and visualization using `graphviz` or similar.
   
2. **User Roles**:
   - Implement roles (e.g., owner, editor, viewer) using Pundit for authorization.

3. **Custom Domain Support**:
   - Allow tenants to map custom domains to their subdomains.

4. **Search**:
   - Use a library like Lunr.js or Elasticsearch to enable full-text search across wikis.

---

This architecture is robust, scalable, and fully integrates with GitHub for authentication and repository management. Let me know if you'd like further details on specific components!

Do I need to have a pg database?

Strictly speaking, **you don't need a PostgreSQL (pg) database** for a Rails app that serves multiple Gollum-based tenants if your use case doesn't involve significant relational data or querying beyond what Gollum and Git provide. However, having a database offers advantages, especially for managing users, tenants, and additional features. Let me break this down.

---

## **When You Need a Database**
A database like PostgreSQL is recommended if you:
1. **Manage Users and Authentication**:
   - Storing user details, OAuth tokens (e.g., GitHub tokens), roles, and access control.
   - Example: Devise requires a database for user authentication.

2. **Store Tenant Metadata**:
   - Information like tenant names, subdomains, or custom configurations.
   - Example: Each tenant has a unique name, GitHub repo, or theme settings.

3. **Search or Index Content**:
   - If you need full-text search or content indexing across wikis, databases like PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch provide powerful tools.
   - Example: Indexing titles, tags, and backlinks from Markdown files.

4. **Analytics and Metrics**:
   - Tracking tenant activity, user actions, or wiki usage statistics.

---

## **When You Donâ€™t Need a Database**
You can skip a database if:
1. **You Rely Entirely on Git**:
   - Gollum uses Git as the data store for all wiki content.
   - Tenant metadata (e.g., subdomain configuration) could be managed in a simple YAML file or environment variables.

2. **Minimal Relational Needs**:
   - If thereâ€™s no need for complex queries or relationships (e.g., between users and tenants).

3. **Static Features**:
   - If the app serves primarily as a Git-based dynamic or static content manager with minimal interaction beyond Git and Markdown.

---

## **Alternatives to PostgreSQL**
If you decide not to use PostgreSQL, here are alternatives:

### 1. **SQLite**
- **Use Case**: Lightweight local database.
- **Pros**:
  - Easy setup (no server required).
  - Ideal for simple applications with low traffic.
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for high-concurrency environments or scaling.

### 2. **YAML or JSON Files**
- **Use Case**: Store metadata in structured files.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and Git-friendly.
  - No additional database setup.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited query capabilities.
  - Managing updates and concurrency can get complex.

Example for tenant metadata in `tenants.yml`:
```yaml
tenants:
  - name: "Tenant A"
    subdomain: "tenant-a"
    repo: "https://github.com/user/tenant-a-wiki"
  - name: "Tenant B"
    subdomain: "tenant-b"
    repo: "https://github.com/user/tenant-b-wiki"
```

### 3. **Redis**
- **Use Case**: Lightweight key-value store for caching or minimal metadata.
- **Pros**:
  - High-performance and simple structure.
  - Useful if you already use Redis for caching or background jobs.
- **Cons**:
  - Less suitable for relational data.

### 4. **No Database or Filesystem Only**
- **Use Case**: Minimalist setup.
- **Pros**:
  - Fully Git-based, with no database to maintain.
  - Markdown files and Git handle all storage.
- **Cons**:
  - Managing additional data like user roles or tenant configurations can get cumbersome.

---

## **Recommended Approach**
If your app manages **users and tenants**, PostgreSQL or SQLite is ideal for simplicity and scalability. Hereâ€™s why:
- **User Management**: Devise (or any authentication system) benefits from a database.
- **Tenant Metadata**: Storing tenant-specific info (e.g., subdomains, GitHub repos) is more robust with a database.
- **Future Expansion**: Adding analytics, search, or other features will be easier.

However, if you prioritize **lightweight simplicity** and only manage tenants via Git repositories:
- Skip the database and use Gollumâ€™s Git-backed storage.
- Store additional metadata (e.g., tenant info) in YAML files or GitHub repo descriptions.

---

## **How to Adjust the Rails App Without a Database**

### Remove Database-Dependent Gems
If skipping the database, remove these from your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
# Remove database-related gems
gem 'pg'
gem 'sqlite3'
```

### Use YAML for Metadata
Store tenant metadata in `config/tenants.yml`:
```yaml
tenants:
  tenant-a:
    name: "Tenant A"
    repo: "https://github.com/user/tenant-a-wiki"
  tenant-b:
    name: "Tenant B"
    repo: "https://github.com/user/tenant-b-wiki"
```

Load this YAML file in your Rails app:
```ruby
TENANTS = YAML.load_file(Rails.root.join('config', 'tenants.yml'))
```

Access it in controllers:
```ruby
def find_tenant(subdomain)
  TENANTS[subdomain]
end
```

---

## **Final Recommendation**
1. If you're just starting and want to keep things simple:
   - Use SQLite or YAML for metadata.
   - Stick to Git as the primary store for wikis.

2. If you expect growth and need robust features:
   - Use PostgreSQL to manage users and tenants.
   - Integrate Git for storing wiki content.

For long-term scalability, PostgreSQL is the best choice if you plan to extend the app with user roles, search, or analytics. Let me know if you'd like to see specific code for any of these approaches!

So how my rails app contains the gollum server? Please show me again the multitenancy implementation

To implement **multitenancy in a Rails app containing a Gollum server**, follow these steps. This design dynamically serves a separate Gollum wiki for each tenant based on their subdomain.

---

## **Step 1: Project Setup**

### Install Gems
Add the required gems for the app:

```ruby
gem 'gollum'          # Gollum server for managing wikis
gem 'omniauth-github' # GitHub authentication
gem 'octokit'         # GitHub API client
gem 'pg'              # PostgreSQL for multitenancy
gem 'pundit'          # Optional, for role-based access
gem 'dotenv-rails'    # For environment variables
```

Run `bundle install`.

---

## **Step 2: Database Schema for Multitenancy**

### Tenant Model
Create a `Tenant` model to manage tenant-specific metadata, such as names and associated repositories:

```bash
rails generate model Tenant name:string subdomain:string:index github_repo:string owner:references
rails db:migrate
```

In `app/models/tenant.rb`:

```ruby
class Tenant < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :owner, class_name: 'User'
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, through: :memberships

  validates :name, :subdomain, :github_repo, presence: true
  validates :subdomain, uniqueness: true
end
```

### Membership Model
Create a `Membership` model to associate users with tenants:

```bash
rails generate model Membership user:references tenant:references role:string
rails db:migrate
```

In `app/models/membership.rb`:

```ruby
class Membership < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :tenant

  validates :role, inclusion: { in: %w[owner editor viewer] }
end
```

---

## **Step 3: Gollum Configuration for Multitenancy**

### Gollum Directories
Store each tenantâ€™s Gollum repository in a dedicated directory:

```bash
mkdir -p repos
```

The structure will look like:

```
repos/
â”œâ”€â”€ tenant1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
â”œâ”€â”€ tenant2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
```

### Gollum Service
Create a service to initialize and manage Gollum repositories. In `app/services/gollum_service.rb`:

```ruby
class GollumService
  BASE_PATH = Rails.root.join('repos')

  def initialize(tenant)
    @tenant = tenant
    @repo_path = BASE_PATH.join(@tenant.subdomain)
  end

  def setup_repo
    return if Dir.exist?(@repo_path)

    # Clone GitHub repo or initialize a new one
    if @tenant.github_repo.present?
      system("git clone #{@tenant.github_repo} #{@repo_path}")
    else
      Rugged::Repository.init_at(@repo_path.to_s)
    end
  end

  def commit_changes(file_path, content, message)
    repo = Rugged::Repository.new(@repo_path)
    oid = repo.write(content, :blob)
    index = repo.index
    index.add(path: file_path, oid: oid, mode: 0o100644)
    options = {
      tree: index.write_tree(repo),
      author: { email: 'admin@example.com', name: 'Admin', time: Time.now },
      committer: { email: 'admin@example.com', name: 'Admin', time: Time.now },
      message: message,
      parents: [repo.head.target].compact,
      update_ref: 'HEAD'
    }
    Rugged::Commit.create(repo, options)
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 4: Routes and Gollum Integration**

### Routes
Mount Gollum dynamically for each tenant based on the subdomain. Update `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  constraints subdomain: /.+/ do
    mount ->(env) {
      subdomain = env['HTTP_HOST'].split('.').first
      tenant = Tenant.find_by!(subdomain: subdomain)
      Gollum::App.new(settings: { gollum_path: Rails.root.join("repos", tenant.subdomain) })
    }, at: '/'
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 5: Tenant Controller**

Create a `TenantsController` to manage tenant creation and metadata updates.

```bash
rails generate controller Tenants index new create
```

In `app/controllers/tenants_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class TenantsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def index
    @tenants = current_user.tenants
  end

  def new
    @tenant = Tenant.new
  end

  def create
    @tenant = current_user.tenants.build(tenant_params)

    if @tenant.save
      GollumService.new(@tenant).setup_repo
      redirect_to tenants_path, notice: 'Tenant created successfully!'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def tenant_params
    params.require(:tenant).permit(:name, :subdomain, :github_repo)
  end
end
```

---

## **Step 6: GitHub Authentication and Sync**

### GitHub Integration
Use Octokit to interact with GitHub repositories. In `app/services/github_service.rb`:

```ruby
class GithubService
  def initialize(user)
    @client = Octokit::Client.new(access_token: user.github_token)
  end

  def create_repo(repo_name)
    @client.create_repository(repo_name)
  end

  def add_collaborator(repo_name, collaborator)
    @client.add_collaborator(repo_name, collaborator)
  end
end
```

### Webhook Sync
Add a webhook endpoint to pull updates from GitHub repositories. In `app/controllers/webhooks_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def github
    payload = JSON.parse(request.body.read)
    subdomain = payload['repository']['name']
    tenant = Tenant.find_by!(subdomain: subdomain)
    GollumService.new(tenant).setup_repo
    head :ok
  end
end
```

Update `routes.rb`:

```ruby
post '/webhooks/github', to: 'webhooks#github'
```

---

## **Step 7: Deployment**

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `.env` for secrets like `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

2. **Hosting**:
   - Deploy the app to a platform like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**.
   - Ensure the `repos/` directory is writable and persistent.

3. **Domain Setup**:
   - Use wildcard subdomains (e.g., `*.example.com`) for tenants.
   - Configure DNS settings to point to your Rails app.

---

## **Step 8: Optional Features**

1. **Search**:
   - Add search functionality using Elasticsearch or Lunr.js.

2. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Use Pundit to manage tenant-specific roles (e.g., owner, editor, viewer).

3. **Backlink Graphs**:
   - Implement backlink visualization with `graphviz` or similar.

4. **Theming**:
   - Allow tenants to customize their wiki themes via configuration files.

---

This implementation sets up a multitenant Rails app with Gollum, leveraging subdomains for tenant isolation and GitHub for repository management. Let me know if you'd like detailed code for any specific part!

how can I interact with it, then? Can I simply go to tenant1.localhost:3000 and that should be it?

Yes, after implementing the multitenant Gollum integration in the Rails app, you should be able to interact with tenant-specific wikis by accessing subdomains like `tenant1.localhost:3000`.

Hereâ€™s how it works and how to set it up for local development:

---

## **How Subdomains Work in Rails**

1. **Routing Logic:**
   - The `constraints subdomain: /.+/` in `routes.rb` ensures that Rails matches the subdomain and maps it to the corresponding tenant.

2. **Dynamic Gollum Mounting:**
   - The Gollum server for each tenant is dynamically mounted by identifying the subdomain in the request (e.g., `tenant1` in `tenant1.localhost:3000`).

3. **Serving Tenant-Specific Content:**
   - The app looks up the `Tenant` model using the subdomain (e.g., `tenant1`) and serves the Gollum instance tied to that tenant.

---

## **Steps to Interact with the App**

### 1. **Set Up Subdomains Locally**

#### Edit Your `hosts` File
On your local machine, modify your `hosts` file to map subdomains to `localhost`. For example:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add these lines:

```
127.0.0.1 tenant1.localhost
127.0.0.1 tenant2.localhost
```

This makes `tenant1.localhost` and `tenant2.localhost` accessible in your browser.

#### Use a Rails Development Server That Supports Subdomains
By default, Rails' built-in server (`rails server`) works with subdomains on `localhost`. You don't need special configurations beyond the `hosts` file changes.

Start your Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

---

### 2. **Access the App**

#### Test Tenant-Specific Wikis
1. Create a tenant via the Rails app UI (e.g., at `localhost:3000/tenants/new`).
2. Once the tenant is created, its subdomain (e.g., `tenant1`) should correspond to a directory in the `repos` folder.
3. Visit `tenant1.localhost:3000` to see the Gollum wiki for that tenant.

---

### 3. **Interacting with Gollum**

When you visit `tenant1.localhost:3000`, you should:
1. See the default Gollum wiki interface (if no customizations were made).
2. Be able to:
   - View pages.
   - Edit pages using the built-in editor.
   - Create new pages using the `New Page` button.

Edits are automatically committed to the Git repository for that tenant.

---

### 4. **GitHub Integration**

#### Sync Changes
If the tenant's wiki is tied to a GitHub repository:
- Any edits made through the Gollum interface will be committed locally to the Git repository.
- The app can push these changes to GitHub using the `GollumService` or `GithubService`.

#### Pull Updates
When changes are made directly on GitHub (e.g., through a user's local clone), the app can sync updates:
- GitHub webhook triggers a pull.
- The Gollum repository for the tenant is updated.

---

### 5. **Debugging Subdomain Issues**

If `tenant1.localhost:3000` doesnâ€™t work:
1. **Check Your `hosts` File:**
   Ensure the subdomains are mapped correctly.

2. **Check Rails Routing:**
   Confirm that `constraints subdomain: /.+/` is in your `routes.rb` and correctly identifies the subdomain.

3. **Log Tenant Lookup:**
   Add logging in your routing logic or controllers to ensure the tenant is being correctly identified:
   ```ruby
   logger.info "Subdomain: #{request.subdomain}"
   ```

4. **Check Gollum Repository:**
   Ensure the tenant's repository exists and is initialized in the `repos` folder.

---

### 6. **Enhancing the Experience**

- **Custom Wiki URLs:**
  Use `tenant1.yourapp.com` instead of `tenant1.localhost`. Configure a wildcard DNS (`*.yourapp.com`) and SSL certificate for production.

- **Custom Themes:**
  Allow tenants to define their own themes by storing CSS configurations in their repositories.

- **Admin Dashboard:**
  Create a dashboard to manage tenants, GitHub integration, and Gollum repositories.

---

By following these steps, you can interact with tenant-specific wikis simply by navigating to the appropriate subdomain, such as `tenant1.localhost:3000`. Let me know if you encounter issues or need further guidance!
