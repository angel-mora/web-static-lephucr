Spaced repetition strategy for CompTIA Security+ prep 

Spaced repetition is a highly effective technique for retaining information. Here's a strategy tailored to preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam using spaced repetition:

1. **Gather Resources**: Start with the official CompTIA Security+ study guide and other reputable sources.

2. **Breakdown Topics**: Divide the syllabus into smaller sections or topics. For example:
    - Network Security
    - Compliance and Operational Security
    - Threats and Vulnerabilities
    - Application, Data, and Host Security
    - Access Control and Identity Management
    - Cryptography

3. **Create Flashcards**:
    - Use a platform like Anki, Quizlet, or physical cards.
    - One concept per card, with a clear question on one side and answer on the other.
    - Include diagrams or mnemonic devices where appropriate.

4. **Initial Review**: 
    - Study the cards topic by topic, ensuring you understand each concept.
    - Don't try to memorize, but understand the reasoning behind each answer.

5. **Spaced Repetition Schedule**: 
    - Day 1: Review a set of cards. Those you get right, set aside for review in 3 days. Those you get wrong, review the next day.
    - Day 2: Review the cards you got wrong from Day 1. Also, start a new set. Repeat the process.
    - Day 3: Review cards you got wrong on Day 2. Also, revisit Day 1 cards.
    - Continue this process, spacing out correct cards for longer periods: 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and so on.

6. **Regular Practice Tests**:
    - After covering all topics, take a practice test.
    - Any areas you struggle with, revisit those flashcards or even create new ones to reinforce weak spots.

7. **Active Engagement**:
    - Join forums, study groups, or discussion platforms related to Security+. Discussing topics and answering questions can serve as another layer of spaced repetition.

8. **Continuous Review**: 
    - Even if you feel confident about a topic, revisit flashcards at longer intervals (e.g., every month).

9. **Adjust As Needed**:
    - If you find certain topics more challenging, adjust your repetition frequency. For instance, if cryptography is hard for you, you might review those cards more often than others.

10. **Final Review**: 
    - 1-2 weeks before the exam, intensify your review process. Take more practice exams, review flashcards more frequently, and engage in active discussion.

Remember, the key to spaced repetition is consistency. Regularly reviewing and reinforcing your knowledge will help you retain the material better and improve your confidence when sitting for the exam.
