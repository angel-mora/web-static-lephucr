It sounds like you're referring to **RailsGoat**, an intentionally vulnerable Ruby on Rails application developed by OWASP to help developers and security professionals learn about security vulnerabilities within the Rails framework. RailsGoat includes examples of vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10, such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), among others. citeturn0search0

You can access RailsGoat and its resources through the following platforms:

- **GitHub Repository**: The source code and documentation are available on GitHub. citeturn0search0

- **Official Website**: Provides tutorials and guidance on getting started with RailsGoat. citeturn0search1

- **Attack-Defense Platform**: Offers an online version of RailsGoat, allowing you to practice without setting up the environment locally. citeturn0search2

To get started with RailsGoat locally, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Getting Started guide](https://railsgoat.cktricky.com/getting_started.html). This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process, enabling you to explore and learn about various security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

Additionally, there's a comprehensive [OWASP Global Webinar by Ken Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPwnzH-5udI) that delves into RailsGoat, providing insights into its purpose and how to effectively use it for learning Rails security.

By engaging with RailsGoat, you'll gain hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security issues within Ruby on Rails applications, enhancing your understanding of secure coding practices. 

Nope, it's a private, interactive platform


I understand you're seeking a private, interactive platform focused on Ruby on Rails security, similar to platforms like HackerRank or Coderbyte. While specific private platforms used internally by companies like Mastercard may not be publicly accessible, there are several reputable resources that offer interactive learning experiences in Rails security:

1. **CMD+CTRL Security's Ruby on Rails Developer Learning Path**: This platform provides a comprehensive learning path tailored for Ruby on Rails developers. It covers core, advanced, and elite topics, emphasizing secure application development practices. The curriculum includes hands-on labs and real-world threat scenarios to enhance your understanding of Rails security. citeturn0search2

2. **Pluralsight's "Ruby on Rails 7 Security and Performance" Course**: This course delves into web application security within the Ruby on Rails framework. It teaches how to secure user data, prevent vulnerabilities, and implement robust authentication mechanisms. The course is structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical application. citeturn0search1

3. **Gem Shop by Paraxial.io**: Although not a private platform, Gem Shop is an intentionally vulnerable Ruby on Rails 8 application designed for security education. It offers practical examples of common vulnerabilities, allowing developers to practice identifying and mitigating security issues in a controlled environment. citeturn0search0

While these platforms may not be private in the same sense as internal corporate tools, they offer interactive and practical approaches to mastering Rails security. Engaging with these resources can provide valuable hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of secure coding practices within the Ruby on Rails framework. 

are those interactive?

Yes, the resources previously mentioned offer interactive learning experiences:

1. **CMD+CTRL Security's Ruby on Rails Developer Learning Path**: This platform provides immersive, hands-on labs where you can engage with real-world threat scenarios, allowing you to actively practice and apply security concepts within Ruby on Rails applications. citeturn0search0

2. **Pluralsight's "Ruby on Rails 7 Security and Performance" Course**: Pluralsight offers interactive courses that combine video lessons with practical exercises. While the specific interactivity of this course isn't detailed, Pluralsight's platform typically includes assessments and projects to reinforce learning. citeturn0search1

3. **Gem Shop by Paraxial.io**: This intentionally vulnerable Ruby on Rails application allows you to interactively explore and address common security vulnerabilities, providing a practical environment to apply security principles.

Engaging with these resources will provide you with practical, hands-on experience in Ruby on Rails security.
