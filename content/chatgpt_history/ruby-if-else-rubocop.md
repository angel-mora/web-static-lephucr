In Ruby, you can use `if`, `else`, and `unless` for conditional statements. RuboCop, a Ruby static code analyzer and formatter, recommends certain styles for writing these

statements, especially when they are used in a single line.

Here's a quick guide:

1. **Single-line `if`/`unless` Statements**: Use these for short, simple conditions.
   - `do_something if condition`
   - `do_something unless condition`

2. **Avoid `if`/`else` in a Single Line**: RuboCop discourages using `if`/`else` in a single line because it can make the code harder to read.
   - Instead of `condition ? if_true : if_false`, use multi-line `if`/`else`.

3. **Consistency**: RuboCop emphasizes consistency in the codebase. If your project follows a specific style, it's best to stick to it.

Remember, RuboCop's suggestions are meant to improve readability and maintainability of code. It's always good to consider the context and purpose of your code when deciding how to structure it.
