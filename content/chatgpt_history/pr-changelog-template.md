Basic changelog template for a pr description in github



Here’s a simple changelog template you can use for a pull request (PR) description on GitHub:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of the changes introduced in this PR.

## Changes
- [ ] Feature 1: Short description
- [ ] Feature 2: Short description
- [ ] Bugfix: Description of the bug fixed
- [ ] Refactor: Any refactoring of code
- [ ] Docs: Documentation updates

## Testing
- How were these changes tested? (unit tests, manual testing, etc.)
- Links to tests or screenshots (if applicable)

## Related Tickets/Issues
- Link to Jira or GitHub issues this PR addresses (if applicable).

## Checklist
