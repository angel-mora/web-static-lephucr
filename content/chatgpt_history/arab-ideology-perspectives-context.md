I want to understand the arab ideology over time. Provide book references, preferably cultural/antropological/historical but that also consider war/military positions. One of them from an IDF academic and one of them from a palestine-side perspective.

Understanding the Arab ideology over time, especially in the context of cultural, anthropological, historical, and military perspectives, requires delving into a broad and complex field of study. Here are some book recommendations that span these areas, including viewpoints from both an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) academic perspective and a Palestinian perspective. These books provide a variety of insights into the socio-political dynamics, historical context, and cultural aspects of Arab societies, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

### From an IDF Academic Perspective

1. **"The Arab Mind" by Raphael Patai**
   - Although not directly from an IDF academic, Raphael Patai's work has been influential in military circles, including the U.S. military, and provides an anthropological and cultural perspective on Arab societies. It explores the psychological underpinnings of Arab culture, touching upon aspects that are relevant to understanding military positions and strategies. Critics argue that it generalizes Arab culture and has been used to stereotype, so it's important to read it with a critical eye.

2. **"Warrior's Way: A 21st Century Soldier's Rite of Passage" by Eyal Ben-Ari**
   - Eyal Ben-Ari is an Israeli anthropologist who has written extensively on the IDF. This book explores the socialization of soldiers in the IDF, touching upon how Israeli military culture and practices reflect and shape broader societal norms and values, including perceptions of the Arab "other."

### From a Palestinian Perspective

1. **"The Other Side of the Wall: An Eyewitness Account of the Occupation in Palestine" by Richard Hardigan**
   - While Richard Hardigan is not Palestinian, this book provides an eyewitness account of the occupation from a perspective that is sympathetic to the Palestinian side. It offers insights into the daily struggles and resistance of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.

2. **"Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness" by Rashid Khalidi**
   - Rashid Khalidi is a prominent Palestinian-American historian, and this book delves into the historical and cultural roots of Palestinian identity. It provides a comprehensive overview of the formation of Palestinian national consciousness in response to historical pressures, including conflict with Zionism and Israeli policies.

### Additional Recommendations

- **"Orientalism" by Edward Said**
  - Although not specifically about the Arab-Israeli conflict, Edward Said's seminal work is crucial for understanding Western perceptions of the Arab world. Said, a Palestinian-American scholar, critiques Western cultural representations of the East, which have influenced both scholarly and general Western attitudes toward the Arab world and the conflict.

- **"A History of the Arab Peoples" by Albert Hourani**
  - This book offers a comprehensive history of Arab societies from the pre-Islamic era to the late 20th century, providing valuable context for understanding the current socio-political dynamics in the Arab world.

These books, each from their respective viewpoints, contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex tapestry of Arab ideology, culture, history, and the specific dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reading a range of perspectives is essential for a balanced understanding of these deeply intertwined and contentious issues.
