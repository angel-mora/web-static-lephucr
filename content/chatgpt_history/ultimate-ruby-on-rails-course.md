The ultimate course to teach someone Ruby on Rails and also programming at the same time



For someone looking to learn Ruby on Rails and programming simultaneously, a comprehensive course should cover both foundational programming concepts and Rails-specific practices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of a course that would work as an "ultimate" learning path:

### 1. **Introduction to Programming (using Ruby)**
   - **Goal**: Build a solid foundation in programming with Ruby before diving into Rails.
   - **Content**:
     - Variables, data types, control flow (if/else, loops)
     - Functions, methods, and object-oriented programming
     - Data structures (arrays, hashes) and algorithms
     - Basic file handling and libraries
   - **Resources**: 
     - *The Odin Project* or *Launch School* for Ruby fundamentals

### 2. **Introduction to Web Development**
   - **Goal**: Learn the basics of web development, including HTTP, front-end technologies, and how web apps work.
   - **Content**:
     - HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics
     - How the web works (HTTP, request/response cycle)
     - Basic web forms, sessions, and cookies
   - **Resources**: 
     - *MDN Web Docs* for HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals

### 3. **Ruby on Rails Basics**
   - **Goal**: Start using Rails to build simple applications and understand the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.
   - **Content**:
     - Introduction to Rails, routing, and MVC pattern
     - Working with models, views, and controllers
     - Migrations, ActiveRecord, and setting up databases
     - Creating CRUD applications (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - **Project**: Build a simple blog or to-do app.
   - **Resources**: 
     - *Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial* â€“ This is widely regarded as one of the best introductions to Rails. It covers Rails fundamentals along with Git, testing, and deployment.

### 4. **Intermediate Ruby on Rails**
   - **Goal**: Deepen understanding of Rails and build more complex features.
   - **Content**:
     - Associations, validations, and callbacks
     - Nested resources, RESTful routes, and forms
     - Authentication and authorization (e.g., using Devise)
     - Background jobs, ActiveJob, and Sidekiq
     - Introduction to testing (unit, integration, and system testing with RSpec)
   - **Project**: Build a more complex app with user authentication (e.g., a blog with user accounts and comments).
   - **Resources**: 
     - *GoRails* screencasts for deeper dives into specific topics like authentication and testing.
     - *The Odin Project* advanced Rails path.

### 5. **Advanced Rails and Deployment**
   - **Goal**: Master advanced Rails features and learn deployment strategies.
   - **Content**:
     - API development with Rails (using JSON, working with external APIs)
     - Websockets and ActionCable for real-time features
     - Advanced caching, performance optimization
     - Deployment to platforms like Heroku or AWS
   - **Project**: Build a full-fledged app (e.g., a marketplace or social network) with real-time updates and API integration.
   - **Resources**: 
     - *GoRails* for advanced topics and API development
     - *Deploying Rails* book for in-depth coverage on deployment and scaling.

### 6. **Capstone Project**
   - **Goal**: Consolidate all learning by building a real-world project from scratch.
   - **Project**: Design and develop a full-featured web app, such as an e-commerce site, social network, or project management tool.
   - Focus on implementing complex features like user roles, notifications, and third-party integrations.
   - **Resources**: 
     - *RailsCasts* and *GoRails* for specific features and solutions
     - Feedback and code review from mentors or online communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub)

By progressing through this structured learning path, learners will not only grasp Ruby on Rails but also develop solid programming skills along the way. Combining resources like *The Odin Project*, *Michael Hartl's tutorial*, and *GoRails* will provide comprehensive guidance at every level.

I mean a url pointing to a complete course

A complete course that teaches both Ruby on Rails and programming fundamentals is available through *The Odin Project*. It provides a full curriculum, starting with the basics of programming (using Ruby) and moving all the way to building complex Rails applications.

Here's the URL:
- [The Odin Project - Full Stack Ruby on Rails Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails)

This course is free, comprehensive, and includes hands-on projects to build your skills step by step.

Canâ€™t open the url

If you're unable to open the link directly, you can search for "The Odin Project Full Stack Ruby on Rails" using a search engine. The course is hosted on *The Odin Project's* official site under their Full Stack Ruby on Rails learning path.

Alternatively, hereâ€™s another option:
- [Launch School - Software Engineering Track](https://launchschool.com/)

Launch School offers a more in-depth, paid program that covers Ruby, web development fundamentals, and Rails, with a focus on mastery. Itâ€™s ideal if you want a guided and structured approach to learning both programming and Rails.

If these links are still inaccessible, let me know and I can guide you through a manual setup.
