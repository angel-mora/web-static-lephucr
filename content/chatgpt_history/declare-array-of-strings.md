how can i declare an array of strings using let(:) in rspec

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

In RSpec, `let` is used to define a memoized helper method. The purpose of using `let` is to create a memoized variable that you want to use across multiple examples in a spec file. When you want to declare an array of strings using `let`, you can do it like this:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'An array of strings' do
  let(:array_of_strings) { ['string1', 'string2', 'string3'] }

  it 'has the correct number of elements' do
    expect(array_of_strings.size).to eq(3)
  end

  it 'contains all string elements' do
    expect(array_of_strings).to all(be_a(String))
  end
end
```

In this example, `array_of_strings` is the name of the method that `let` is creating, and the block `{ ['string1', 'string2', 'string3'] }` is where you define the value that this method returns, which is an array of strings.

The `let` block is lazily evaluated, which means it only gets evaluated when you first call the method it defines. From that point on, the value is cached and the block is not evaluated again in the same example. If you want the block to be evaluated for each example, you can use `let!` instead of `let`, which forces the method's invocation before each example.
