easiest and coolest way to put a table of contents in my obsidian publish page



Adding a **table of contents (TOC)** to your Obsidian Publish page can make navigation easier for your readers. Here are a few of the coolest and easiest ways to do it:

---

### **1. Use Obsidian's Built-in Heading Links**
- Obsidian Publish automatically generates IDs for your headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.), allowing you to link to them.
- You can manually create a TOC by adding links at the top of your page:
  ```markdown
  ## Table of Contents
  - [Section 1](#section-1)
  - [Section 2](#section-2)
  - [Conclusion](#conclusion)

  ## Section 1
  Content here...

  ## Section 2
  Content here...

  ## Conclusion
  Final notes here...
  ```
---

### **2. Use a Plugin (Advanced)**
If you use Obsidian locally before publishing, you can install a plugin to automate TOC generation:

- Install the **"Table of Contents" plugin**:
  1. Go to **Settings > Community Plugins** and enable it.
  2. Install the "Table of Contents" plugin.
  3. Run the TOC command to generate a dynamic TOC based on the headings in your document.

- Paste the generated TOC into the file before publishing.

### **3. CSS Styling for Extra Coolness**
For a modern look, add CSS to style your TOC. You can create collapsible sections or hover effects for your links. Example:

```css
/* Style for the TOC */
.toc {
    margin-top: 20px;
    padding: 10px;
    border-left: 4px solid #6c63ff;
    background-color: #f4f4f9;
}

.toc a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #6c63ff;
}

.toc a:hover {
    color: #ff6f61;
}
```

- Add the CSS to your Obsidian Publish custom styles.
- Wrap your TOC links in a `div` with the `toc` class:
  ```markdown
  <div class="toc">
  - [Section 1](#section-1)
  - [Section 2](#section-2)
  - [Conclusion](#conclusion)
  </div>
  ```

### **4. Markdown Embeds for a Minimalist Approach**
If you want a cleaner workspace, you can create a separate file (e.g., `toc.md`) with your TOC and embed it where needed:

```markdown
![[toc]]
```

This keeps your primary document focused on content while maintaining a linked TOC.

---

### **5. JavaScript for Dynamic TOC (Pro Option)**
For even more customization, you can embed a simple JavaScript snippet to generate a TOC dynamically. This would require publishing your page with custom HTML headers.
