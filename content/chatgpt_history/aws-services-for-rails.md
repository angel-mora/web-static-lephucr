Tell me which aws services I should know if I use rails as monolith and as api. SQL and Redis. Elasticsearch. Docker. Logging (like Cloudwatch)

For a Rails application that functions both as a monolithic application and as an API, using SQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Docker, and requires logging capabilities, you'd benefit from familiarizing yourself with a set of AWS services that support these requirements efficiently. Here's a breakdown:

### Core Infrastructure

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: For running your Rails application in the cloud. EC2 instances can host your Docker containers, or you can directly deploy your Rails application onto the instances.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** or **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: If you're using Docker, these services are for orchestrating your containers. ECS is simpler to manage if you're exclusively in the AWS ecosystem. EKS is beneficial if you want the portability of Kubernetes.

### Database and Data Management

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: For SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery.
- **ElastiCache**: For Redis. It's a managed Redis and Memcached service for scenarios requiring in-memory data storage and caching.
- **OpenSearch Service (formerly Elasticsearch Service)**: For Elasticsearch needs. It offers managed Elasticsearch which is compatible with open-source Elasticsearch APIs, simplifying setup, management, and scaling.

### Storage

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: For storing files, backups, and static assets. It's highly scalable and integrates well with other AWS services.

### Networking

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: To isolate your cloud resources and define a virtual network to securely manage your services and applications.
- **Route 53**: For DNS and domain management. It can route your users to your application's endpoints.

### Developer Tools

- **CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline**: For continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). These services help automate
