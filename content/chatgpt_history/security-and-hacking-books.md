I want to read books about physical installations hacking to start up a company for cybersecurity and physical security for big factories.

Physical security is a critical component of comprehensive security strategies, especially for industries and organizations where assets are at risk from physical tampering or unauthorized access. If you're looking to understand physical installations hacking and beef up the security of big factories or similar installations, here's a list of recommended books to help you get started:

1. **"Locks, Safes, and Security: An International Police Reference" by Marc Weber Tobias**
    - A comprehensive guide on various locking mechanisms and their vulnerabilities. It is considered the bible for anyone interested in physical penetration testing.

2. **"Physical Security Principles" by Michael E. Knoke**
    - This book covers the foundation of physical security and its principles, providing a holistic understanding.

3. **"Practical Lock Picking: A Physical Penetration Tester's Training Guide" by Deviant Ollam**
    - Deviant Ollam's approach to lock picking is rooted in real-world applications. This book is great for beginners and offers clear illustrations and detailed explanations.

4. **"The Design and Evaluation of Physical Protection Systems" by Mary Lynn Garcia**
    - This offers a methodical approach to the design and evaluation of physical protection systems, detailing the integration of electronic and physical security measures.

5. **"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems" by Ross Anderson**
    - While the focus is broader than just physical security, there are dedicated sections on tamper resistance and emission security.

6. **"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security" by Kevin D. Mitnick & William L. Simon**
    - While not strictly on physical security, this book delves into social engineering, a key tool for many attackers looking to breach physical spaces.

7. **"The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities: An Interagency Security Committee Standard"**
    - An in-depth guide on risk management and security strategies tailored for federal facilities but applicable to other large installations as well.

When diving into these books, it's essential to maintain an ethical stance. Remember, hacking tools and techniques should be applied to improve security, not exploit it maliciously. Once you have a solid foundation in physical security concepts and tactics, you'll be better positioned to advise big factories and other enterprises on their physical security needs.

Lastly, consider supplementing your reading with hands-on training and courses in the realm of physical security and penetration testing. This practical experience will be invaluable when starting your cybersecurity and physical security company.

Books about hacking heuristics? It can be technical (for programmers) and non-technicals

Hacking heuristics generally involve cognitive shortcuts or rules of thumb used to simplify decision-making in cybersecurity or penetration testing scenarios. A comprehensive understanding of hacking heuristics can help both technical and non-technical individuals make faster decisions when identifying vulnerabilities, threats, or potential attack vectors. Here are some books that discuss hacking, both from technical and non-technical perspectives:

**Technical Books:**

1. **"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition" by Jon Erickson**
    - This is a classic in the hacking literature. It covers the fundamentals of hacking, including a deep dive into networking, programming, and the basics of exploitation. 

2. **"Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide" by David Kennedy, Jim O'Gorman, Devon Kearns & Mati Aharoni**
    - A guide to the world's most popular penetration testing software.

3. **"The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws" by Dafydd Stuttard & Marcus Pinto**
    - This focuses on web application vulnerabilities and gives you a solid grounding in how to spot and exploit them.

4. **"Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters" by Justin Seitz**
    - Offers a dive into using Python for various hacking tasks.

**Non-Technical Books:**

1. **"Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker" by Kevin Mitnick & William L. Simon**
    - Mitnickâ€™s autobiography provides insights into the mindset of a hacker. While it's a story, the tactics and heuristics he employed come out clearly.

2. **"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security" by Kevin D. Mitnick & William L. Simon**
    - Focuses on social engineering, which is more about manipulating people than systems.

3. **"The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage" by Cliff Stoll**
    - A real-life tale of tracking a hacker through a network. It gives insights into both the mindset of a hacker and the heuristics used by security experts to track and trap them.

4. **"Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World" by Bruce Schneier**
    - Schneier delves into the risks associated with our connected world and offers a perspective on how to think about security in a holistic manner.

5. **"Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World" by Bruce Schneier**
    - A look at the broader world of data privacy, surveillance, and how entities (both state and non-state) seek to exploit data for various purposes.

When studying hacking heuristics, remember that the goal is to improve security, ensure ethical practices, and understand the mindset of potential adversaries. Always approach this knowledge with a commitment to ethical standards and the intent to protect and inform.

Now some books from critical theory about hacking

Critical theory, a philosophical approach to culture, literature, and art, intersects with hacking in interesting ways. It critiques the societal structures and values that produce and are produced by technological practices. When applied to hacking, critical theory delves into power dynamics, the role of technology in society, and the ethical implications of digital practices. Here are some texts that use a critical theory lens to discuss hacking:

1. **"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace" by Lawrence Lessig**
    - Lessig presents an understanding of how code (software) functions as a type of law in cyberspace, shaping behaviors, rights, and societal norms.

2. **"Protocol: How Control Exists After Decentralization" by Alexander R. Galloway**
    - This book delves into the technology and politics of the internet and digital culture. It's an exploration of the power dynamics at play in our decentralized digital networks.

3. **"The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age" by Pekka Himanen, with Linus Torvalds and Manuel Castells**
    - Himanen contrasts the Protestant work ethic with the "hacker ethic." This book goes into the philosophical motivations and implications of hacker culture and its impact on the Information Age.

4. **"Cyber-Proletariat: Global Labour in the Digital Vortex" by Nick Dyer-Witheford**
    - A critical examination of the digital economy and its implications for labor, power dynamics, and class struggles.

5. **"The Exploit: A Theory of Networks" by Alexander R. Galloway and Eugene Thacker**
    - This work dives deep into global networks of power and the potential for resistance within them. It views hacking as one such mode of resistance.

6. **"Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous" by Gabriella Coleman**
    - Coleman, an anthropologist, offers an in-depth view of the hacktivist collective Anonymous, examining its cultural, political, and social implications.

7. **"In the Shadows of the Net: Breaking Free from Compulsive Online Sexual Behavior" by Patrick Carnes, David L. Delmonico, and Elizabeth Griffin**
    - While not solely about hacking, it uses a critical lens to understand the implications of online behaviors and the societal structures that shape them.

8. **"Dark Code: Silicon Valley and the Systemic Corruption of American Democracy" by Margaret O'Mara**
    - A critical look at the power dynamics and political implications of technology giants in Silicon Valley.

Remember, critical theory's goal is to critique and unpack the underlying structures and power dynamics of societal systems. These texts provide a more profound, philosophical understanding of hacking beyond just the technical elements, allowing readers to comprehend the broader societal implications.
