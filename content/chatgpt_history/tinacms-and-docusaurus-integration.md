# TinaCMS and Docusaurus Integration

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

can tina and docusaurus live together? Tell me the best git compatible headless cms. I was thinking about Gollum in ruby but I'm open to get the best from multiple languages

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, **TinaCMS** and **Docusaurus** can live together, but their integration would require careful planning since they serve different purposes:

- **TinaCMS**: A headless CMS designed to edit Markdown, JSON, or YAML files stored in Git repositories. It's focused on in-place editing with a React-based interface.
- **Docusaurus**: A static site generator built for documentation websites, which also works with Markdown. It's Git-friendly but more tailored for organizing and presenting technical docs or blogs.

### How They Can Coexist
You can integrate TinaCMS as a front-end editing layer for the Markdown files that Docusaurus reads. In this case:
1. TinaCMS provides an easy editing interface for content creators.
2. Docusaurus handles static site generation and deployment.

The challenge lies in ensuring seamless synchronization between TinaCMS and the Docusaurus file structure. Some manual configuration or middleware might be necessary.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

tell me the obsidiosaurus libraries I would just need to add to strapi. Also tell me how can I make the obsidian graph using a javascript library

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

### **Obsidiosaurus Libraries to Add to Strapi**
To integrate **Obsidiosaurus-style** features into **Strapi**, you'll primarily need libraries that handle Markdown processing, file management, and content graph visualization. Here are the main libraries and tools:

---

#### **1. Markdown Parsing and Rendering**
- **[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)**:
  - A fast and flexible Markdown parser that can convert Markdown into HTML.
  - Use this to process and render Markdown content stored in Strapi.

  ```bash
  npm install markdown-it
  ```

  ```javascript
  const MarkdownIt = require('markdown-it');
  const md = new MarkdownIt();
  const htmlContent = md.render(markdownContent);
  ```

---

#### **2. Frontmatter Parsing**
- **[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)**:
  - Parses frontmatter (YAML or JSON) from Markdown files, useful for metadata like tags, categories, and dates.
  - Add this to handle metadata extraction when importing Markdown content into Strapi.

  ```bash
  npm install gray-matter
  ```

  ```javascript
  const matter = require('gray-matter');
  const { content, data } = matter(markdownFile);
  console.log(data); // Metadata
  console.log(content); // Markdown content
  ```

---

#### **3. Graph Visualization**
- To create the Obsidian-style **content graph**, integrate:
  - **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)**: For creating interactive graphs.
  - **[vis-network](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network)**: Lightweight and simpler to use than D3.js, ideal for visualizing nodes and edges.

  ```bash
  npm install vis-network
  ```

  ```javascript
  import { Network } from 'vis-network';

  const nodes = [
    { id: 1, label: 'Note 1' },
    { id: 2, label: 'Note 2' },
  ];

  const edges = [
    { from: 1, to: 2 },
  ];

  const container = document.getElementById('graphContainer');
  const data = { nodes, edges };
  const options = {};
  const network = new Network(container, data, options);
  ```

---

#### **4. File Management**
- **[fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)**:
  - Handle Markdown files on the server-side, including reading, writing, and importing them into Strapi.
  - Use this to sync Obsidiosaurus-style Markdown files with Strapi's database.

  ```bash
  npm install fs-extra
  ```

  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs-extra');
  const content = await fs.readFile('path/to/markdown.md', 'utf8');
  ```

---

### **Making the Obsidian Graph with JavaScript**
To create a graph like Obsidianâ€™s **knowledge graph**, use the **vis-network** library (or **D3.js** for more customization).

---

#### **Steps to Create the Graph**
1. **Extract Metadata and Links**:
   - Parse your Markdown files using **gray-matter** to extract metadata and interlinks.

     ```javascript
     const links = [];
     markdownFiles.forEach((file) => {
       const { data, content } = matter(file);
       const internalLinks = content.match(/\[\[(.*?)\]\]/g); // Extract [[WikiLinks]]
       internalLinks.forEach((link) => {
         links.push({ source: fileName, target: link });
       });
     });
     ```

2. **Build Nodes and Edges**:
   - Create nodes for each Markdown file and edges for their links.

     ```javascript
     const nodes = markdownFiles.map((file, index) => ({
       id: index + 1,
       label: file.name,
     }));

     const edges = links.map((link) => ({
       from: nodes.find((node) => node.label === link.source).id,
       to: nodes.find((node) => node.label === link.target).id,
     }));
     ```

3. **Render the Graph**:
   - Use **vis-network** to visualize nodes and edges.

     ```javascript
     const container = document.getElementById('graphContainer');
     const data = { nodes: new vis.DataSet(nodes), edges: new vis.DataSet(edges) };
     const options = { physics: { enabled: true } }; // Enable interactive physics
     const network = new Network(container, data, options);
     ```

4. **Add Interactivity**:
   - Enable clicking on nodes to open their corresponding Markdown files.

     ```javascript
     network.on('click', (params) => {
       const nodeId = params.nodes[0];
       const clickedNode = nodes.find((node) => node.id === nodeId);
       if (clickedNode) {
         window.open(`/markdown/${clickedNode.label}`, '_blank');
       }
     });
     ```
