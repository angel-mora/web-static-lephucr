The error you're encountering suggests that the `make` command is not found or not properly installed on your system. This command is essential for building native extensions for some Ruby gems. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Install Development Tools:**
   Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed. On most Linux distributions, you can install them with the following commands:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

   For Fedora or CentOS:

   ```sh
   sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
   ```

2. **Ensure `make` is Installed:**
   Verify that `make` is installed by running:

   ```sh
   make --version
   ```

   If `make` is not installed, you can install it with:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install make
   ```

3. **Install Additional Libraries:**
   Some gems might require additional libraries. For Racc, you typically need these installed:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
   ```

4. **Reinstall the Gem:**
   After ensuring all necessary tools are installed, try installing the gem again:

   ```sh
   gem install racc -v '1.8.0'
   ```

### Verification

- **Check Environment:** Verify that your Ruby environment is correctly set up with `rbenv`:

  ```sh
  rbenv versions
  ```

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install gems. If you encounter permissions issues, you might need to use `sudo` or adjust your user permissions.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please share any additional error messages or logs, and I'll help you further troubleshoot the problem.
