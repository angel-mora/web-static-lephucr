ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Give me a bunch of queries in gmail to cleanup my inbox the fastest

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To quickly clean up your Gmail inbox, you can use the following search queries to find and manage specific types of emails. Remember to replace any placeholders (e.g., "example.com") with the relevant information for your specific needs.

1. Unread emails: `is:unread`
2. All emails with attachments: `has:attachment`
3. Emails from a specific sender: `from:email@example.com`
4. Emails to a specific recipient: `to:email@example.com`
5. Emails containing a specific subject: `subject:keyword`
6. Emails containing a specific word or phrase: `"keyword"`
7. Emails received before a specific date: `before:YYYY/MM/DD`
8. Emails received after a specific date: `after:YYYY/MM/DD`
9. Emails with a specific label: `label:label-name`
10. Emails marked as spam: `in:spam`
11. Emails marked as important: `is:important`
12. Emails larger than a specific size: `larger:size-in-bytes`
13. Emails smaller than a specific size: `smaller:size-in-bytes`
14. Emails that have been starred: `is:starred`
15. Emails in a specific category (e.g., promotions): `category:promotions`
16. Emails that match multiple criteria: `(from:email@example.com is:unread)`

After entering your desired query in the search bar, select all the emails you want to manage and use Gmail's options to mark as read/unread, archive, delete, move to a different folder, or apply a label.

For a massive cleanup, you can select all emails in the search results by clicking the checkbox in the top left corner, then click "Select all conversations that match this search" to apply an action to all emails matching your query.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Explain to me the most useful operators for advance queries in gmail search bar. Also tell me the query language for that search bar

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Gmail's search bar uses a query language that allows you to combine various operators to create advanced search queries. Here are some of the most useful operators:

1. `is:` - Searches for messages with a specific status, such as unread, starred, or important. Example: `is:unread`

2. `from:` - Searches for messages from a specific sender. Example: `from:email@example.com`

3. `to:` - Searches for messages sent to a specific recipient. Example: `to:email@example.com`

4. `cc:` and `bcc:` - Searches for messages with a specific email address in the CC or BCC fields. Example: `cc:email@example.com`

5. `subject:` - Searches for messages containing specific words or phrases in the subject line. Example: `subject:invoice`

6. `label:` - Searches for messages with a specific label. Example: `label:family`

7. `has:` - Searches for messages with specific attributes, such as attachments, phone numbers, or links. Example: `has:attachment`

8. `list:` - Searches for messages from a specific mailing list. Example: `list:newsletter@example.com`

9. `filename:` - Searches for messages with attachments that have a specific file name or file type. Example: `filename:report.pdf`

10. `""` - Searches for exact phrases by enclosing them in double quotes. Example: `"meeting agenda"`

11. `( )` - Groups multiple search terms together, often used with the `OR` operator. Example: `(from:email1@example.com OR from:email2@example.com)`

12. `OR` - Searches for messages that match either of the specified terms. Example: `from:email1@example.com OR from:email2@example.com`

13. `-` - Excludes messages that contain a specific term. Example: `from:email@example.com -subject:newsletter`

14. `before:` and `after:` - Searches for messages received before or after a specific date (in YYYY/MM/DD format). Example: `after:2022/01/01 before:2022/12/31`

15. `larger:` and `smaller:` - Searches for messages larger or smaller than a specific size (in bytes, K, or M). Example: `larger:1M`

16. `category:` - Searches for messages in a specific Gmail category, such as promotions, updates, or forums. Example: `category:promotions`

These operators can be combined to create more complex queries for precise filtering and organization of your Gmail inbox.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Give me a query to gell all the emails not read that came in from the email that has sent emails the most

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To find all the unread emails from the sender who has sent you the most emails, you'll need to perform a two-step process, as Gmail's search bar doesn't support a single query for this specific task.

Step 1: Identify the sender who has sent you the most emails.

1. Go to the search bar in Gmail and enter the query `*` to display all emails.
2. Sort the emails by "From" if possible or skim through the results to identify the sender who appears the most frequently. Note the sender's email address.

Step 2: Create a search query for unread emails from the identified sender.

1. Use the `from:` and `is:` operators with the sender's email address and "unread" status. For example, if the sender's email address is email@example.com, the query will be `from:email@example.com is:unread`.

Enter the query from Step 2 in the Gmail search bar to display all unread emails from the sender who has sent you the most emails.
