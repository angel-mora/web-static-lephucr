ðŸ™‹ **You:**

so could I use Gollum-lib for Jekyll instead of using gollum poor UI?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, you could use **Gollum-lib** to handle the backend logic for managing and rendering content in a **Jekyll-based** project, instead of relying on the full **Gollum** application with its user interface. This approach has several advantages and trade-offs:

---

### **How You Could Use Gollum-lib with Jekyll**
1. **Content Management:**
   - Use **Gollum-lib** to interact with your Git repository programmatically, allowing you to read, write, and update content stored in the repository.
   - Jekyll would then handle the static site generation using the content provided by Gollum-lib.

2. **Rendering Markdown:**
   - Gollum-lib supports various markup languages and can convert markdown to HTML, which Jekyll can then format with its themes and layouts.

3. **Custom API or Interface:**
   - Instead of using Gollum's Sinatra-based UI, you could build your own front-end interface for creating and editing content, tailored to your specific needs.
   - This interface can use Jekyll's Liquid templates for better control over the design.

4. **Multitenancy or Automation:**
   - Gollum-lib can power backend operations like syncing changes across multiple Git repositories, making it useful for multitenancy scenarios in a Jekyll-powered platform.

---

### **Benefits of Using Gollum-lib with Jekyll**
1. **Custom UI and Flexibility:**
   - By bypassing Gollum's built-in interface, you can create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that matches your Jekyll site design.

2. **Powerful Git Integration:**
   - Leverage Gollum-libâ€™s robust Git support for managing content versioning and history.

3. **Modular Architecture:**
   - Jekyll handles the front-end (themes, static pages), while Gollum-lib manages the backend (content management).

4. **Maintain Jekyll Ecosystem:**
   - Continue using Jekyllâ€™s ecosystem of plugins and themes while enriching its backend capabilities with Gollum-lib.

---

### **Trade-offs and Challenges**
1. **Development Effort:**
   - Building a custom interface or integrating Gollum-lib with Jekyll will require additional development time and resources.

2. **No Built-in Collaboration Features:**
   - Gollum-lib doesn't include features like a user management system or collaboration tools, so these would need to be built separately if required.

3. **Performance Overhead:**
   - Depending on how you implement the integration, there might be additional overhead in coordinating Gollum-lib with Jekyllâ€™s static site generation process.

---

### **Implementation Suggestions**
- **API Layer:** Use Gollum-lib to expose an API that interacts with your Git repository. For instance:
  - `GET /content/:page` to fetch a specific page.
  - `POST /content/:page` to create or edit content.

- **Admin Interface:** Build a custom interface using a front-end framework (like React or Vue) or use Jekyll Admin.

- **Static Site Integration:** Once content is updated via Gollum-lib, trigger a Jekyll build process to regenerate the site with the new content.

---

### **Conclusion**
Using **Gollum-lib** with **Jekyll** can be a powerful combination for creating a Git-based content management system with a better UI and the benefits of Jekyll's static site generation. Itâ€™s especially useful if you dislike Gollumâ€™s default UI and want a modern, tailored solution.

---

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

so could I use jekyll digital garden template with editor.js and gollum-lib? Or would it be better using obsidiosaurus and tinacms and still do some kind of multitenancy? Would it better to have the API being rails or building a node app that uses js/ts?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Choosing between these options depends on your goals, priorities, and the trade-offs you're willing to make. Here's a breakdown of each approach, including how they align with **multitenancy**, **API choices**, and integration complexity.

---

## **1. Jekyll Digital Garden Template + Editor.js + Gollum-lib**
### **Advantages**
- **Static Site Simplicity:**
  - Jekyll generates a fast, static site, and the Digital Garden template is already designed for note-taking and linking.
- **Rich Editor (Editor.js):**
  - Editor.js provides a modern, block-based editor that can enhance the editing experience.
- **Powerful Git Backend (Gollum-lib):**
  - Gollum-lib integrates Git-backed content versioning, ensuring edits are stored robustly.

### **Challenges**
- **Complex Integration:**
  - Combining Editor.js, Jekyll, and Gollum-lib requires custom development for syncing content between the editor and the Git repository.
- **Multitenancy Workaround:**
  - Jekyll doesn't natively support multitenancy, so you'd need a separate layer (like a Rails or Node app) to manage users and their individual content repositories.
- **Build Overhead:**
  - Each edit would require triggering a Jekyll rebuild, which can become resource-intensive for multitenancy.

### **When to Choose This**
- You love Jekyll's ecosystem and prefer static site generation for simplicity and speed.
- You're okay with more complex backend development to tie everything together.
- Multitenancy is not a hard requirement or can be managed with a separate user layer.

---

## **2. Obsidiosaurus + TinaCMS + Multitenancy**
### **Advantages**

  - Obsidiosaurus leverages Obsidian's Markdown conventions, which means users can seamlessly sync local Obsidian vaults with your platform.
- **Inline Editing (TinaCMS):**
  - TinaCMS offers a smooth inline editing experience for non-technical users, making content updates simple.
- **Native Multitenancy:**
  - You can design a multitenant architecture where users have isolated instances for their content.

### **Challenges**
- **Setup Complexity:**
  - TinaCMS may require more effort to configure for multitenancy, especially with Obsidiosaurus.
- **Performance Concerns:**
  - TinaCMS and Obsidiosaurus rely on a real-time Markdown rendering layer, which can be slower than static builds in Jekyll for large-scale deployments.
- **Dependency on Node/React:**
  - TinaCMS is heavily Node/React-based, so you need expertise in this stack.

### **When to Choose This**
- You value seamless integration with Obsidian.
- Multitenancy is a key requirement, and you want isolated user workspaces.
- Real-time editing and a modern UI are high priorities.

---

## **API: Rails vs. Node/JS**
### **Using Rails**
- **Advantages:**
  - You already have expertise in Rails (based on your bio).
  - Rails' ecosystem supports building robust APIs with tools like `Active Storage`, `ActionCable`, and `Devise` for user management.
  - Easy integration with `Gollum-lib` since both are Ruby-based.
- **Challenges:**
  - Real-time functionality (e.g., live collaboration) may be harder to implement compared to Node.js, although ActionCable can help.

### **Using Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)**
- **Advantages:**
  - Editor.js and TinaCMS are naturally aligned with a Node.js stack, making integration smoother.
  - Real-time collaboration features (e.g., websockets) are simpler to implement using libraries like `Socket.IO`.

  - You prefer using modern JavaScript/TypeScript for full-stack development.

---

## **Recommendation Based on Priorities**
1. **If Jekyll Simplicity is a Must:**
   - Use **Jekyll Digital Garden Template**, **Editor.js**, and **Gollum-lib** with a Rails-based API to manage multitenancy and rebuild workflows.

2. **If Obsidian Integration is Key:**
   - Go with **Obsidiosaurus** and **TinaCMS** using a Node.js API to handle real-time editing and user isolation for multitenancy.

3. **If Multitenancy is Critical:**
   - Focus on building a Node.js or Rails API to orchestrate tenant separation, regardless of the front-end editor (Editor.js or TinaCMS).

---

### **Final Thoughts**
If you're more comfortable with Rails and need robust multitenancy with Git integration, a Rails API with Gollum-lib and Jekyll (or Obsidiosaurus) is a solid choice. However, if real-time editing and modern tooling are priorities, a Node.js app leveraging TinaCMS would be more forward-looking.

---

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

so can't I link jekyll with multitenancy only over gollum-lib?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

You **can** link Jekyll with multitenancy using **Gollum-lib**, but it requires a well-thought-out architecture to bridge the gap between Jekyll's static site generation and the multitenancy model. Here's how it could work and what you need to consider:

---

## **How Jekyll + Multitenancy + Gollum-lib Can Work**
1. **Gollum-lib as a Git Backend:**
   - Use **Gollum-lib** to manage content in Git repositories for each tenant. Each tenant would have their own repository (or branch) to store Markdown files and wiki content.

2. **Jekyll for Static Site Generation:**
   - Jekyll reads from the content repository (managed by Gollum-lib) to generate static sites for each tenant.

3. **Multitenancy Layer:**
   - Build a multitenancy-aware application (Rails or Node.js) that orchestrates:
     - Creating and managing tenant repositories (e.g., a new Git repo for each tenant).
     - Triggering Jekyll builds for specific tenants when their content changes.
     - Serving the generated static sites uniquely for each tenant.

4. **Editing Interface:**
   - Replace Gollumâ€™s default UI with a custom editor (e.g., **Editor.js**, Obsidian, or a custom front-end).
   - Use APIs powered by Gollum-lib to fetch, update, and save content back to the tenant's repository.

5. **File System or Git Workflow:**
   - Sync edited content via Gollum-lib into the corresponding Git repository.
   - Trigger a Jekyll rebuild after each update to reflect changes in the static site.

---

### **Key Components of the Setup**
| Component               | Tool/Technology                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content Management**  | Gollum-lib (handles Git operations for Markdown content).                       |
| **Static Site Generation** | Jekyll (builds tenant-specific static sites).                                |
| **Multitenancy API**     | Rails (or Node.js) to manage tenants, repositories, and trigger site builds.   |
| **Editing Interface**    | Custom front-end (e.g., Editor.js or another Markdown editor).                 |
| **Hosting Static Sites** | S3/Netlify/Vercel for tenant-specific hosting, or Nginx/Traefik for routing.   |

---

### **Steps to Implement**
1. **Tenant Management:**
   - Store tenant metadata (e.g., name, URL, Git repo path) in a central database.
   - Dynamically create Git repositories for new tenants using Gollum-lib APIs.

2. **Content Editing and Versioning:**
   - Allow users to edit Markdown content through a custom editor.
   - Use Gollum-lib to push updates to their respective repositories.

3. **Trigger Static Builds:**
   - Watch for changes in tenant repositories (e.g., webhooks or manual triggers).
   - Run Jekyll builds for the tenant's repository to generate updated static files.

4. **Serve Static Sites:**
   - Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Traefik) to route requests to the correct tenant's static site.

---

### **Challenges**
1. **Build Performance:**
   - Jekyll rebuilds can become slow if you have many tenants or large sites.
   - You might need to optimize Jekyll with incremental builds or alternative generators like Hugo (which is faster).

2. **Scaling Multitenancy:**
   - Hosting many tenant sites may require infrastructure planning, especially for isolated repositories and build pipelines.

3. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Jekyll is not inherently real-time. Consider a live preview feature during editing that bypasses Jekyll for immediate feedback.

4. **Complexity of Integration:**
   - Custom development is necessary to connect Gollum-lib, Jekyll, and your multitenancy system.

---

### **When This Makes Sense**
- You prefer **static site simplicity** and don't need real-time editing.
- You want to leverage **Git-backed versioning** via Gollum-lib for content management.
- You are okay with triggering **manual or automated rebuilds** for site updates.

---

### **Alternative Approach**
If the integration complexity feels overwhelming:
- Consider replacing Jekyll with a real-time, database-driven solution (like **TinaCMS** or a headless CMS) for easier multitenancy.
- Use **Rails** or **Node.js** as the API backend to manage content and multitenancy.

---

### **Conclusion**
Yes, you can link Jekyll with multitenancy over Gollum-lib, but it requires significant development effort to handle:
1. Tenant-specific Git repo management.
2. Jekyll build automation for each tenant.
3. Routing and hosting static sites.

If youâ€™re comfortable with the static site model and its limitations, this setup works. For more dynamic use cases, consider a headless CMS or TinaCMS-based solution instead.

Consider it has stripe subscription for tenants and enforcing roles based on github .CODEOWNERS or something like that, how would my architecture look like then? I want to understand what would require a node app and what a Rails one

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Adding **Stripe subscriptions** for tenants and **role-based access control (RBAC)** based on `.CODEOWNERS` introduces new dimensions to the architecture. Here's how this extended system could work, clarifying which responsibilities are best suited for **Node.js** and which for **Rails**.

---

## **Updated Architecture with Stripe Subscriptions and Role-Based Access**

### **1. Key Requirements**
1. **Multitenancy with Stripe:**
   - Tenants subscribe to your platform, and their access is gated based on subscription status (e.g., active, trial, expired).
2. **Role Enforcement via `.CODEOWNERS`:**
   - Access to specific content or repositories is managed using GitHub's `.CODEOWNERS` file.
3. **Jamstack Frontend:**
   - Content remains static and fast, built dynamically with modern Jamstack tools.
4. **Efficient API Backend:**
   - A backend to handle multitenancy, Stripe integrations, and RBAC tied to GitHub.

---

### **2. Architectural Components**

#### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** 
  - Use **Next.js** for a modern Jamstack frontend with **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**.
  - Dynamically fetch tenant-specific content at runtime using API calls.

- **Stripe Subscription Frontend:**
  - Integrate Stripe's **Checkout** or **Customer Portal** for subscription management.
  - Use **Stripe.js** for client-side payment interactions.

---

#### **Backend Responsibilities**
##### **Core Backend Responsibilities**
1. **Multitenancy:**
   - Manage tenants and their subscriptions in the backend.
   - Map each tenant to their own Git repository, content, and custom subdomain.

2. **Stripe Integration:**
   - Handle Stripe webhooks to track subscription events (e.g., trial started, subscription canceled).
   - Enforce access based on subscription tiers (e.g., free, basic, premium).

3. **Role Enforcement (RBAC):**
   - Parse and enforce roles from `.CODEOWNERS` files in the tenant's Git repository.
   - Use this to control access to content and editing permissions.

4. **Graph Data Management:**
   - Extract backlinks and content relationships from Markdown/YAML during content sync.
   - Optionally store relationships in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j).

---

#### **Node.js vs. Rails: Backend Division of Labor**
| Feature                              | **Node.js** Responsibilities                          | **Rails** Responsibilities                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stripe Integration**               | Handle Stripe webhooks and subscription validation.  | Same functionality but potentially more verbose.       |
| **GitHub Integration**               | Parse `.CODEOWNERS` and enforce roles dynamically.   | Rails can handle this too but less suited for real-time tasks. |
| **Tenant Management**                | Lightweight management of tenant metadata.           | Comprehensive tenant management via ActiveRecord.     |
| **Real-Time Updates**                | WebSockets for live editing and collaborative features. | ActionCable for live updates and real-time notifications. |
| **Graph Database**                   | Manage Neo4j/RedisGraph for fast graph queries.      | Use ActiveRecord for graph data, but less optimized.  |
| **API for Jamstack Frontend**        | REST/GraphQL for Next.js.                            | REST/GraphQL with Rails API.                          |
| **Content Syncing (TinaCMS)**        | Sync Markdown with Git repositories via TinaCMS.     | Rails can manage syncing but adds overhead.           |

---

### **3. Complete Architectural Layout**

#### **Frontend (Next.js)**
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Dynamically fetch content for each tenant via APIs.
  - Handle user login and subscription management with Stripe.js.
  - Render role-based UI elements based on API-provided RBAC data.
- **Technologies:**
  - Framework: **Next.js**
  - Styling: TailwindCSS or Chakra UI.
  - Payment: **Stripe.js**.

---

#### **Backend**
**Option 1: Node.js Backend**
- **Stripe Subscription Management:**
  - Use **Stripe SDK** to create and manage subscriptions.
  - Handle Stripe webhooks to monitor subscription events (e.g., payments, cancellations).
- **RBAC via `.CODEOWNERS`:**
  - Parse `.CODEOWNERS` files using Git libraries (e.g., `simple-git` or `isomorphic-git`).
  - Dynamically enforce permissions when users interact with tenant-specific content.

**Option 2: Rails Backend**
- **Stripe Subscription Management:**
  - Use the **Stripe Ruby gem** for handling subscriptions and webhooks.
  - Integrate with ActiveRecord for robust tenant and user models.
- **RBAC via `.CODEOWNERS`:**
  - Use Ruby-based Git libraries (e.g., `rugged`) to parse `.CODEOWNERS`.
  - Combine with Rails authorization gems like **Pundit** or **CanCanCan** for role enforcement.

---

#### **Git Content Management**
- **TinaCMS for Editing:**
  - Use TinaCMS for tenant content editing with real-time syncing to Git repositories.
- **Git Storage:**
  - Store tenant content in separate Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Enforce `.CODEOWNERS` rules by validating users against the file during API requests.

---

#### **Graph Database (Optional)**
- Store backlinks and content relationships extracted from Markdown in a graph database (e.g., **Neo4j**, **RedisGraph**).
- Provide API endpoints to query graph data for frontend visualizations.

---

#### **Hosting and Deployment**
- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify for static file delivery and ISR.
- **Backend Hosting:**
  - For Node.js: AWS Lambda, Fly.io, or Vercel Functions.
  - For Rails: Heroku, Render, or Fly.io.
- **Git Repositories:** Host tenant repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution like Gitea.

---

### **4. Workflow**

1. **Onboarding New Tenants:**
   - Tenant signs up via Stripe subscription.
   - Backend provisions a Git repository for the tenant and initializes default Markdown content.

2. **User Roles:**
   - Authenticate users via GitHub OAuth.
   - Backend parses `.CODEOWNERS` from the tenant's Git repository and assigns roles dynamically.

3. **Content Editing:**
   - Users edit Markdown content via TinaCMS.
   - TinaCMS commits changes to the Git repository.

4. **Graph Updates:**
   - Backend extracts graph data from Markdown during sync.
   - Updates a graph database for fast querying and visualization.

5. **Frontend Delivery:**
   - Next.js fetches tenant content via APIs.
   - Render static pages dynamically with ISR, caching results for fast delivery.

---

### **Why Use Node.js vs. Rails**
| **Use Node.js** If:                             | **Use Rails** If:                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| You prioritize real-time features (e.g., collaborative editing). | You prefer robust tenant management with ActiveRecord. |
| You want tighter integration with TinaCMS and modern tools. | You prefer Rails' ecosystem for authentication and authorization. |
| You're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript full stack. | You're more experienced with Rails and prefer convention over configuration. |
| You want lightweight, scalable APIs for Jamstack. | You're building a tightly integrated app with a monolithic structure. |

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **Frontend:** Next.js for Jamstack static site generation with ISR.
- **Backend:** 
  - **Node.js** for a modern, lightweight, and real-time-capable API.
  - **Rails** if you prefer robust tenant management, built-in features like ActiveStorage, and Ruby-based tooling.
- **Git Management:** TinaCMS for editing and syncing Markdown to tenant repositories.
- **Stripe Integration:** Use either backend (Node.js or Rails) to handle subscriptions and enforce access control.
- **RBAC:** Dynamically parse `.CODEOWNERS` in the backend and enforce roles via the API.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

obsidiosaurus and tinacms can live together? If not, how could they conflict?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

**Obsidiosaurus** and **TinaCMS** can theoretically coexist in the same project, but there are potential **conflicts** and architectural challenges to consider. Here's a detailed breakdown of their capabilities, how they might interact, and possible ways to resolve conflicts or integrate them effectively.

---

### **Capabilities Overview**

#### **TinaCMS**
- **Purpose:** A Git-backed CMS that provides a user-friendly, inline editing experience for Markdown files and static content.
- **Strengths:**
  - Inline editing and live preview of content.
  - Git-based content management (integrates with GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
  - Flexible APIs for defining custom fields and workflows.
- **Potential Limitation:**
  - Limited focus on Obsidian-style Markdown conventions or graph relationships.

#### **Obsidiosaurus**
- **Purpose:** A library that parses and renders Obsidian-compatible Markdown, supporting backlinks and graph relationships.
- **Strengths:**
  - Obsidian-style bidirectional linking (`[[Page]]`) and graph data parsing.
  - Markdown conventions fully aligned with Obsidian, including YAML frontmatter and note metadata.
  - Focused on content transformation and relationships (not editing UI).
- **Potential Limitation:**
  - No editing capabilities; focused on Markdown parsing and graph building.

---

### **How They Could Conflict**
#### 1. **Markdown File Management**
- **TinaCMS:**
  - Assumes direct control over the Markdown files for editing and commits changes to Git.
  - Modifies files based on its schema definitions (custom fields, frontmatter structures, etc.).
- **Obsidiosaurus:**
  - Parses Markdown files for Obsidian-specific syntax and metadata.
  - Assumes files adhere to Obsidian's conventions, which may not align with TinaCMS's custom schema.

**Potential Conflict:** TinaCMS might restructure frontmatter or modify content in ways that break Obsidiosaurusâ€™s ability to parse files (e.g., adding non-standard YAML fields or reformatting links).

---

#### 2. **File System Access**
- **TinaCMS:**
  - Directly interacts with the Git repository for file reads and writes.
  - Requires consistent file structure and paths defined in its schema.
- **Obsidiosaurus:**
  - Relies on a flexible file structure, mimicking Obsidian's vault organization.
  - Might conflict if TinaCMS moves or renames files outside Obsidian's expected conventions.

**Potential Conflict:** TinaCMS's schema-driven approach may reorganize files or metadata in ways that disrupt Obsidiosaurusâ€™s parsing logic.

---

#### 3. **Data Handling**
- **TinaCMS:**
  - Focused on editing content for display in static sites (e.g., Next.js).
  - Its data pipeline is not designed to handle graph relationships or backlinks.
- **Obsidiosaurus:**
  - Designed to extract graph relationships and metadata for knowledge management, not editing.

**Potential Conflict:** TinaCMS lacks native support for graph operations, and Obsidiosaurus has no UI for editing content, creating a gap in seamless integration.

---

#### 4. **Graph and Backlink Rendering**
- **TinaCMS:**
  - Provides no native support for graph visualization or backlinks.
- **Obsidiosaurus:**
  - Handles graph and backlink rendering but assumes full control over how links are processed.

**Potential Conflict:** If TinaCMS alters Markdown link formatting (e.g., to support relative paths or custom URL structures), Obsidiosaurus might fail to correctly resolve backlinks.

---

### **How to Make Them Work Together**
#### **1. Define Clear Roles**
- **TinaCMS for Editing:**
  - Use TinaCMS exclusively for content editing, maintaining Markdown files and their metadata.
- **Obsidiosaurus for Graph and Relationships:**
  - Use Obsidiosaurus for parsing Markdown files and generating graph relationships, ensuring the editor (TinaCMS) doesnâ€™t alter link syntax or YAML frontmatter conventions.

#### **2. Standardize Markdown Conventions**
- Establish a shared Markdown schema that both TinaCMS and Obsidiosaurus adhere to:
  - Maintain Obsidian-compatible YAML frontmatter for metadata.
  - Ensure that links (`[[Page]]`) remain consistent and are not reformatted by TinaCMS.

#### **3. Middleware for Conflict Resolution**
- Build middleware to reconcile differences between TinaCMS and Obsidiosaurus:
  - Before Obsidiosaurus processes Markdown, validate and adjust TinaCMS's output to conform to Obsidian conventions.
  - Ensure TinaCMS fields and custom metadata are preserved without breaking Obsidian's expected structure.

#### **4. Custom TinaCMS Plugins**
- Extend TinaCMS to support Obsidian-style links and metadata:
  - Create a plugin to parse and render graph relationships from Markdown.
  - Add validation to ensure changes made in TinaCMS do not break Obsidian compatibility.

#### **5. Backend API for Synchronization**
- Implement an API layer to mediate between TinaCMS and Obsidiosaurus:
  - API reads Markdown files from Git (via TinaCMS) and transforms them into a format Obsidiosaurus can process.
  - Synchronize updates between TinaCMS and Obsidiosaurus in real-time.

---

### **Proposed Workflow**

1. **Content Editing with TinaCMS:**
   - Users edit content inline with TinaCMS, which saves changes to Git.
   - Custom TinaCMS plugins ensure compatibility with Obsidian-style links and metadata.

2. **Graph and Backlink Extraction with Obsidiosaurus:**
   - The backend (e.g., Node.js or Rails) runs Obsidiosaurus to parse updated Markdown files, extracting backlinks and graph data.
   - The parsed graph is stored in a database (e.g., Neo4j or RedisGraph).

3. **Frontend Graph Rendering:**
   - Frontend (e.g., Next.js) queries the graph database to render backlink relationships and interactive graphs (e.g., Cytoscape.js).

4. **Content Serving:**
   - Next.js uses TinaCMSâ€™s edited content and Obsidiosaurusâ€™s graph data to generate tenant-specific static pages.

---

### **When They Work Best Together**
- **Use TinaCMS** to provide a powerful editing experience for non-technical users.
- **Use Obsidiosaurus** to handle knowledge management features like backlinks, graph relationships, and Obsidian compatibility.
- Carefully manage schema and file conventions to ensure compatibility between the two.

---

### **Conclusion**
While **TinaCMS** and **Obsidiosaurus** serve different purposes, they can coexist if:
1. You define a unified Markdown schema and structure.
2. Use TinaCMS exclusively for editing and Obsidiosaurus for parsing and graph operations.
3. Build middleware or plugins to bridge any gaps in functionality.

By combining the two, you can achieve a system that supports both **rich content editing** and **knowledge management** while maintaining a fast, Jamstack-compatible architecture.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Now provide a tutorial to code my app in node.js. Start by telling me the libraries required and how it works. If it's possible to get obsidiosaurus features in tina without having to integrate but cherry-picking features (browse their dependencies if needed). Could I build something that simply integrates with TinaCloud service so I can just delegate the CMS for a plugin I create? My main goal would be to be able to communicate that CMS with an AI API to add more markdown files to the repo with marketing info, that I will push and pull back from Hootsuite. Please provide a structured response and explain stuff before the tutorial only if you feel you need to

### **Step 5: Add AI API for Markdown Generation**
1. Install OpenAI SDK:
   ```bash
   gem install ruby-openai
   ```

2. Generate Markdown with AI:
   - Add a service in Rails to interact with the AI API:
     ```ruby
     class AiContentGenerator
       def self.generate(prompt)
         client = OpenAI::Client.new(api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
         response = client.completions(
           engine: "text-davinci-003",
           parameters: {
             prompt: prompt,
             max_tokens: 500,
           }
         )
         response["choices"].first["text"]
       end
     end
     ```

3. Save AI-generated content:
   - Use Rails ActiveStorage to save the generated Markdown files.

### **Step 6: Push Content to Hootsuite**
1. Install HTTParty for API calls:
   ```bash
   gem install httparty
   ```

2. Integrate Hootsuite API:
   - Add a Hootsuite service:
     ```ruby
     class HootsuiteService
       include HTTParty
       base_uri "https://api.hootsuite.com"

       def self.post_content(content)
         post(
           "/v1/messages",
           headers: { "Authorization" => "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
           body: { text: content }.to_json
         )
       end
     end
     ```
