Markdown Tutorial on how to use a docker container in latex project locally and github actions setup

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Sure! Here's a Markdown tutorial on how to use a Docker container in a LaTeX project locally and set up GitHub Actions to automate the build process:

# Using a Docker container in a LaTeX project

## Step 1: Install Docker

First, you need to install Docker on your local machine. You can follow the official installation guide for your operating system here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Create a new file in your LaTeX project directory called `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions for Docker on how to build your LaTeX project.

Here's an example `Dockerfile` that uses the official `texlive` Docker image:

```
FROM texlive/texlive:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pdflatex document.tex
```

In this example, we're using the latest version of the `texlive` Docker image as our base image. We're then setting the working directory to `/app`, copying the entire LaTeX project directory to `/app`, and finally running `pdflatex` on `document.tex` to build the PDF.

You can customize this `Dockerfile` to suit your specific needs.

## Step 3: Build the Docker image

Open a terminal in your LaTeX project directory and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-latex-project .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory and tags it with the name `my-latex-project`.

## Step 4: Run the Docker container

Now that you've built the Docker image, you can run a container using the following command:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app my-latex-project
```

This command runs a container using the `my-latex-project` Docker image, mounts the current directory as a volume inside the container, and runs the LaTeX build process.

The `--rm` flag tells Docker to remove the container once it's finished running.

## Step 5: Verify the PDF output

Assuming everything went well, you should now have a PDF file in your LaTeX project directory called `document.pdf`. You can open this file to verify that the build was successful.

# Setting up GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and deployment platform that can automatically build and test your LaTeX project every time you push changes to your repository.

Here's how you can set up GitHub Actions to build your LaTeX project using a Docker container:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions workflow file

Create a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/build.yml`. This file contains instructions for GitHub Actions on how to build your LaTeX project.

Here's an example workflow file:

```
name: Build LaTeX document
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build LaTeX document
      uses: docker://my-latex-project:latest
      with:
        working-directory: /github/workspace
```

In this example, we're defining a workflow called "Build LaTeX document" that runs on the `main` branch whenever code is pushed to the repository.

The workflow consists of a single job called `build` that runs on the `ubuntu-latest` operating system. The job has two steps:

- The first step checks out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout` action.
- The second step builds the LaTeX document using the `my-latex-project` Docker image and sets the working directory to `/github/workspace`.

## Step 2: Commit and push the workflow file

and push the workflow file to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new file and start building your LaTeX project whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch.

## Step 3: Monitor the build process

You can monitor the build process by going to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. You should see a list of all the workflow runs, along with their status and logs.

If the build is successful, you can download the PDF file from the "Artifacts" tab. If there are any errors or warnings, you can view them in the logs and make the necessary changes to your LaTeX project.

## Conclusion

Using a Docker container to build your LaTeX project is a great way to ensure that your document is built consistently across different platforms and environments. With GitHub Actions, you can automate the build process and easily collaborate with others on your LaTeX project.
