"Everyday Holiness" is a book by Alan Morinis that explores the Jewish spiritual tradition of Mussar. Mussar is a branch of Judaism focused on ethics, personal growth, and spiritual development. It emphasizes the cultivation of personal qualities such as humility, patience, gratitude, and compassion, aiming to improve one's moral character and relationships with others.

Mussar is not a separate branch of Judaism like Orthodoxy, Conservatism, Reform, or Reconstructionism. Instead, it is a spiritual practice that transcends these denominational lines, focusing on the inner life and ethical improvement. Originating in the 19th century in Lithuania, Mussar was developed by Rabbi Israel Salanter and others who believed that the study of traditional Jewish texts should be applied directly to personal behavior and character development.

"Everyday Holiness" serves as a guide to applying Mussar principles in daily life, offering practical advice on how to engage with this transformative practice. The book is designed to make the ancient teachings of Mussar accessible to a modern audience, providing a pathway for individuals to explore spiritual growth within the framework of Jewish tradition.
