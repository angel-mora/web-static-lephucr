Err:6 http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt jammy-pgdg InRelease
  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8

W: GPG error: http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt jammy-pgdg InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
E: The repository 'http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt jammy-pgdg InRelease' is not signed.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

The error you're encountering indicates that the APT package manager is unable to verify the signature of the PostgreSQL repository because it lacks the appropriate public key. The key with the ID `7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8` is missing, which is required for APT to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the packages being downloaded from the repository.

To resolve this issue, you can manually add the missing public key to your system. This process allows APT to verify the packages from the PostgreSQL repository. You can add the key by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

This command requests the public key from a keyserver and adds it to your system's list of trusted keys. Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `sudo`: Run the command as root, which is required for adding keys to the APT keyring.
- `apt-key adv`: Use the advanced option of `apt-key` to add the key.
- `--keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80`: Specify the keyserver from which to fetch the public key. The port 80 is used to ensure that the request goes through in environments where the default keyserver port (11371) might be blocked.
- `--recv-keys 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8`: Specifies the key ID to be added.

After running this command, you should be able to update your package lists and install packages from the PostgreSQL repository without encountering the signature verification error. Run the following command to update your package lists:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

If you encounter any issues or errors after attempting this fix, please let me know for further assistance.

The error message you're encountering when trying to install the `mysql2` gem indicates a failure to build native extensions. This issue typically arises due to missing development libraries or headers for MySQL on your system. The `mysql2` gem requires MySQL client libraries to be installed to build these extensions.

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:

### 1. Install MySQL Development Libraries

Depending on your operating system, you'll need to install the MySQL development libraries that include the necessary headers and binaries to compile the gem.

#### For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```

#### For Red Hat/CentOS-based systems:

```bash
sudo yum install mysql-devel
```

#### For Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install mysql-devel
```

### 2. Install Ruby Development Libraries

Make sure you have the Ruby development headers installed on your system. These are needed to compile native extensions for gems.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev # For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install ruby-devel # For Red Hat/CentOS
sudo dnf install ruby-devel # For Fedora
```

### 3. Reinstall the `mysql2` Gem

After installing the necessary libraries, try installing the `mysql2` gem again:

```bash
gem install mysql2 -v '0.5.6'
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Once the installation process is complete, you can verify that the `mysql2` gem is installed correctly by running:

```bash
gem list mysql2
```

### Troubleshooting

- If you still encounter errors, make sure the development tools (like `build-essential` on Ubuntu/Debian) are installed.
- Ensure you are using the correct versions of Ruby and the `mysql2` gem that are compatible with each other.
- Check the `mkmf.log` file for specific errors related to the compilation process. It might give you more details on what's missing or causing the issue.

If you've followed these steps and are still facing issues, please provide more details about the error messages in the `mkmf.log` file or any other output you think is relevant.
