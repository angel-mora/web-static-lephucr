Is there anything like rectangle in mac to handle windows/tiles but for linux?

Yes, there are several window management tools for Linux that offer functionality similar to Rectangle for macOS. Rectangle is a window management app for macOS that allows users to quickly organize and manage windows using keyboard shortcuts. In the Linux ecosystem, you have a variety of choices depending on your preferences and the desktop environment you are using. Here are a few options:

1. **Tiling Window Managers**: These are complete window managers dedicated to organizing windows in a tiling format. Examples include i3, awesome, and xmonad. They are highly customizable and efficient, especially for keyboard-centric users.

2. **Extensions for Desktop Environments**: If you are using popular desktop environments like GNOME or KDE Plasma, there are extensions/add-ons available that can provide similar functionality. For GNOME, extensions like "gTile" or "ShellTile" are popular. KDE Plasma has built-in tiling features and KWin scripts like "Krohnkite" that enhance window management.

3. **Standalone Utilities**: There are also standalone utilities like `wmctrl` and `xdotool` which can be used to script window layouts. They are more manual and script-based but highly flexible.

4. **Graphical Tools**: Tools like "QuickTile" or "Tilex" provide a GUI for managing windows in a tiling manner, similar to Rectangle.

Each of these options has its own set of features and customization capabilities. The choice depends on how deeply you want to customize your environment and how integrated you want the window management to be with your existing desktop environment.

What will be more easily set up as rectangle app shortcuts?

For an experience most similar to Rectangle on macOS, which is known for its ease of setup and use, you might want to consider options that require minimal configuration and integrate well with your existing desktop environment. Here are two recommendations based on ease of setup:

1. **GNOME Extensions like gTile or ShellTile (for GNOME Users)**:
   - If you are using the GNOME desktop environment, extensions like gTile or ShellTile can be easily added through the GNOME Extensions website or through your distribution's package manager.
   - These extensions are designed to be user-friendly and integrate seamlessly with the GNOME desktop, offering a GUI and customizable keyboard shortcuts for window tiling.

2. **KWin Scripts like Krohnkite (for KDE Plasma Users)**:
   - For those using KDE Plasma, KWin scripts like Krohnkite can be installed directly from the KDE store or manually.
   - Krohnkite is designed to work within the KDE environment and provides features similar to dynamic tiling window managers, with the convenience of straightforward setup and configuration.

Both of these options are designed to be more user-friendly and require less manual configuration compared to full tiling window managers like i3 or awesome. They provide a good balance between ease of setup and the powerful window management capabilities similar to Rectangle. 

Remember, the ease of setup also depends on your familiarity with your Linux environment and its configuration methods.
