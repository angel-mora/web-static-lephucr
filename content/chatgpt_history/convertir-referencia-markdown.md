How can I move a markdown reference "Saber hacer[^20]" to latex rendereable

To convert a markdown reference like "Saber hacer[^20]" to LaTeX format, you can use the following syntax:

```
Saber hacer\footnote{Text of the footnote.}
```

So, in this case, you would convert "Saber hacer[^20]" to "Saber hacer\footnote{Text of the footnote.}", replacing "Text of the footnote" with the actual text you want to include in the footnote.

Here's an example of how this would look in LaTeX:

```latex
Saber hacer\footnote{The ability to do something well or efficiently.}
```

This would produce the following output:

```
Saber hacerÂ¹

-----------------------
Â¹ The ability to do something well or efficiently.
```

Note that the footnote number is automatically generated by LaTeX and is placed at the end of the sentence. If you have multiple footnotes in your document, LaTeX will number them sequentially.

And those are markdown renderable as well?

Yes, you can use the same syntax in Markdown to create footnotes as you would in LaTeX.

To convert "Saber hacer[^20]" to Markdown format, you would use the following syntax:

```
Saber hacer[^1]

[^1]: Text of the footnote.
```

In this case, "Text of the footnote" should be replaced with the actual text you want to include in the footnote.

Here's an example of how this would look in Markdown:

```
Saber hacer[^1]

[^1]: The ability to do something well or efficiently.
```

This would produce the following output:

```
Saber hacerÂ¹

-----------------------
Â¹ The ability to do something well or efficiently.
```

Note that the footnote number is automatically generated by Markdown, and is placed at the bottom of the page. If you have multiple footnotes in your document, Markdown will number them sequentially.

I mean, markdown interpreter understands the latex \footnote{} ?

No, the Markdown interpreter does not understand the LaTeX `\footnote{}` syntax. While the syntax is similar, Markdown and LaTeX are two different markup languages, and each has its own syntax and rules.

If you want to include footnotes in your Markdown document, you should use the Markdown footnote syntax instead:

```
Saber hacer[^1]

[^1]: The ability to do something well or efficiently.
```

This will create a numbered footnote at the bottom of the page, similar to the output I showed earlier.

If you need to convert Markdown to LaTeX or vice versa, there are tools and libraries available that can help with the conversion process. However, you will need to make sure that the syntax you use is valid for the markup language you are working with.

Is there an alternative for markdown[^20] that is not enumerated and can be translated to latex through pandoc or something?

Yes, there is an alternative syntax for creating footnotes in Markdown that doesn't rely on enumerating them with numbers. This syntax uses caret (^) symbols to mark the beginning of the footnote, and a corresponding caret symbol to mark the end of the footnote:

```
Saber hacer^[The ability to do something well or efficiently.] is an important skill to have.
```

This will create an unenumerated footnote at the bottom of the page, with the text "The ability to do something well or efficiently.".

Pandoc, which is a popular tool for converting between different markup languages, supports this syntax for footnotes in Markdown, and will convert it to the appropriate LaTeX code when you convert your document from Markdown to LaTeX.

Here's an example of how you would convert the Markdown code above to LaTeX using Pandoc:

```
Saber hacer\footnote{The ability to do something well or efficiently.} is an important skill to have.
```

When you run Pandoc to convert this Markdown document to LaTeX, the footnote will be converted to the appropriate LaTeX code, and will appear as an unenumerated footnote at the bottom of the page.

Give me a ruby script to merge all the markdown footnotes from 1-plantar-cara/bibliography.md under the # References heading into each of the markdown files within 1-plantar-cara where there is a reference to that number.
It should split by ': ', remove [ N], add parenthesis to the url

Here is an example Ruby script that will merge all the footnotes from a bibliography file into multiple Markdown files, where there is a reference to that footnote number:

```ruby
# Read the bibliography file
bibliography = File.read("1-plantar-cara/bibliography.md")

# Get all the footnotes from the bibliography
footnotes = bibliography.scan(/\[\^(\d+)\]: (.+)/)

# Group the footnotes by their number
footnote_hash = Hash.new
footnotes.each do |footnote|
  number = footnote[0]
  text = footnote[1]
  footnote_hash[number] = text
end

# Iterate over each Markdown file in the 1-plantar-cara directory
Dir.glob("1-plantar-cara/*.md") do |file|
  # Read the contents of the Markdown file
  contents = File.read(file)

  # Find all the references to footnotes in the file
  references = contents.scan(/\[(\d+)\]/)

  # Iterate over each reference to a footnote in the file
  references.each do |reference|
    number = reference[0]
    footnote_text = footnote_hash[number]

    # Format the footnote text for inclusion in the Markdown file
    footnote_text = footnote_text.split(": ")[1]
    footnote_text = footnote_text.gsub(/\[(\d+)\]/, '')
    footnote_text = "(#{footnote_text})"

    # Replace the reference with the formatted footnote text
    contents = contents.gsub("[#{number}]", "[#{number}#{footnote_text}]")
  end

  # Find the References heading in the file and insert the footnotes
  contents = contents.gsub("# References", "# References\n\n")
  contents = contents.gsub("# References\n\n", "# References\n\n#{footnote_hash.values.join("\n\n")}\n\n")

  # Write the modified contents back to the file
  File.write(file, contents)
end
```

Here's how the script works:

1. The script reads the contents of the bibliography file and extracts all the footnotes from it, storing them in a hash where the key is the footnote number and the value is the footnote text.
2. The script iterates over each Markdown file in the `1-plantar-cara` directory.
3. For each Markdown file, the script finds all the references to footnotes in the file, and replaces them with the corresponding footnote text from the bibliography file.
4. The script then finds the "References" heading in the file, inserts a newline character after it, and adds the footnote text from the bibliography file below it.
5. Finally, the script writes the modified contents of the Markdown file back to the file.

Note that this script assumes that the references to footnotes in the Markdown files are in the format `[N]`, where N is the footnote number. It also assumes that the footnotes in the bibliography file are in the standard Markdown format, with footnote numbers in the format `[^N]` and footnote text in the format `[^N]: URL or footnote text`. If your footnotes have a different format, you may need to modify the script accordingly.

Give me a ruby script to merge all the markdown footnotes from 1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md under the # References heading into each of the markdown files within 1-plantar-cara/00-prologue.md until 07-some-warnings.md.
The script should match the markdown footnotes where there is a reference to that footnote in the other files. The actions taken would be something like:
- Split by ': '
- Remove "[ N]" (pattern of left square bracket, a given number, right square bracket, colons, space)
- Add parenthesis to the content of the footnote

Example Input [^13]: http://bit.ly/2Cddx31
Example Output (in the file that refers to this footnote that starts with 01..07) ^(http://bit.ly/2Cddx31)

Here's an example Ruby script that should accomplish what you're looking for:

```ruby
# Define the filenames for the input and output files
input_files = Dir.glob("1-plantar-cara/00-prologue.md".."1-plantar-cara/07-some-warnings.md")
bibliography_file = "1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md"

# Read the bibliography file and extract the footnote links
footnote_links = {}
File.readlines(bibliography_file).each do |line|
  if line.match(/^\[\^(.*)\]: (.*)$/)
    footnote_links[$1] = $2.strip
  end
end

# Replace the footnote links in the input files
input_files.each do |input_file|
  # Read the input file and split it into lines
  lines = File.readlines(input_file)

  # Find the index of the "# References" heading
  references_index = lines.find_index { |line| line.match(/^# References/) }

  if references_index
    # Split the file into the part before and after the references section
    pre_references = lines[0...references_index]
    post_references = lines[references_index..-1]

    # Replace any footnote links in the post-references section
    post_references.map! do |line|
      line.gsub(/\[\^([^\]]+)\]/) do
        footnote_number = $1
        footnote_content = footnote_links[footnote_number]

        # Format the footnote content and wrap it in parentheses
        "(#{footnote_content.sub(/^\[\d+\]\s+/, '')})"
      end
    end

    # Write the updated file contents to disk
    File.write(input_file, (pre_references + post_references).join(""))
  end
end
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the script works:

1. First, we define the input and output filenames using `Dir.glob`, which allows us to specify a range of filenames to include in the input. In this case, we want to include all files from `00-prologue.md` to `07-some-warnings.md`.

2. Next, we read the bibliography file and extract the footnote links into a hash, where the keys are the footnote numbers (e.g., "13") and the values are the URLs or other footnote contents.

3. For each input file, we find the index of the "# References" heading (if it exists) and split the file into two parts: the part before the references section, and the part after it.

4. We then replace any footnote links in the post-references section of the file by searching for the pattern `\[\^([^\]]+)\]` (which matches a footnote link in Markdown) and replacing it with the corresponding footnote content, formatted as `(content)`.

5. Finally, we write the updated file contents back to disk.

Note that this script assumes that all of the input and output files are in the same directory (`1-plantar-cara/`), and that the bibliography file is named `08-bibliography.md`. You may need to modify the script if your files are located in a different directory or have different filenames.

Give me a ruby script to merge all the markdown footnotes from 1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md under the # References heading into each of the markdown files within 1-plantar-cara/00-prologue.md until 07-some-warnings.md. The target markdown file needs to be scanned through the whole content lines.
The script should match the markdown footnotes where there is a reference to that footnote in the other files. The actions taken would be something like:
- Split by ': '
- Remove "[ N]" (pattern of left square bracket, a given number, right square bracket, colons, space)
- Add parenthesis to the content of the footnote

Example Input [^13]: http://bit.ly/2Cddx31
Example Output (in the file that refers to this footnote that starts with 01..07) ^(http://bit.ly/2Cddx31)

Here's an example Ruby script that should accomplish what you're looking for:

```ruby
# Define the path to the directory containing the markdown files
dir_path = "1-plantar-cara/"

# Define the range of files to search
file_range = (0..7)

# Define the path to the bibliography file
bibliography_path = "#{dir_path}08-bibliography.md"

# Define the heading to search for in the target files
target_heading = "# References"

# Read the content of the bibliography file and extract the footnotes
footnotes = File.read(bibliography_path).scan(/^\[\^(.*?)\]:\s*(.*?)\s*$/m)

# Process each target file in the specified range
file_range.each do |i|
  # Define the path to the target file
  target_path = "#{dir_path}#{sprintf('%02d', i)}-file.md"

  # Read the content of the target file
  content = File.read(target_path)

  # Find the index of the target heading in the file
  heading_index = content.index(target_heading)

  # If the target heading is found, insert the footnotes
  if heading_index
    # Split the content into lines
    lines = content.lines

    # Loop through each footnote
    footnotes.each do |match|
      # Extract the footnote number and content
      number, text = match

      # Remove the footnote number from the content
      text = text.sub(/^\[\d+\]/, '').strip

      # Format the footnote content as a Markdown link
      link = "(^#{text})"

      # Search for references to the current footnote in the file
      matches = lines.grep(/\[\^#{number}\]/)

      # If references are found, replace them with the formatted link
      matches.each do |match|
        content = content.sub(match, link)
      end

      # Insert the formatted footnote at the end of the target heading
      content.insert(heading_index + target_heading.length, "\n#{number}. #{text}\n")
    end

    # Write the updated content back to the file
    File.write(target_path, content)
  end
end
```

To use this script, you'll need to adjust the `dir_path` variable to point to the directory containing your Markdown files, and adjust the `file_range` variable to specify the range of files to search. You'll also need to adjust the `bibliography_path` variable to point to the file containing the footnotes you want to merge.

When you run this script, it will read the content of the bibliography file and extract the footnotes. It will then process each target file in the specified range and insert the footnotes at the end of the target heading, as well as replacing any references to those footnotes with formatted links.

Note that this script assumes that each target file contains a single heading with the text "# References". If your files have a different structure, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly.

Give me a ruby script to merge all the markdown footnotes from 1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md under the # References heading into each of the markdown files within 1-plantar-cara/00-prologue.md until 07-some-warnings.md.
The target markdown file needs to be scanned through the whole content lines since it doesn't have a # References heading. Footnotes can be all over the file.
The script should match the markdown footnotes where there is a reference to that footnote in the other files. The actions taken would be something like:
- Split by ': '
- Remove "[ N]" (pattern of left square bracket, a given number, right square bracket, colons, space)
- Add parenthesis to the content of the footnote

Example Input [^13]: http://bit.ly/2Cddx31
Example Output (in the file that refers to this footnote that starts with 01..07) ^(http://bit.ly/2Cddx31)

Here's a Ruby script that should accomplish what you're looking for:

```ruby
# Define the list of files to search
files_to_search = Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/01-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/02-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/03-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/04-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/05-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/06-*.md') + Dir.glob('1-plantar-cara/07-*.md')

# Create an empty hash to store the footnotes
footnotes = {}

# Iterate over the bibliography file and extract the footnotes
File.open('1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md', 'r') do |file|
  file.each_line do |line|
    if line.start_with?('[^')
      # Extract the footnote number and content
      parts = line.chomp.split(/:\s*/, 2)
      number = parts[0].gsub('[^', '')
      content = parts[1].gsub(/^\s+|\[[^\]]+\]$/, '')

      # Add the footnote to the hash
      footnotes[number] = content
    end
  end
end

# Iterate over the files to search and replace any references to footnotes
files_to_search.each do |filename|
  # Read in the file
  content = File.read(filename)

  # Replace any references to footnotes
  content.gsub!(/\[\s*(\d+)\s*\]/) do |match|
    number = $1
    if footnotes.key?(number)
      "(#{footnotes[number]})"
    else
      match
    end
  end

  # Write out the updated file
  File.write(filename, content)
end
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the script works:

1. We define the list of files to search by using the `Dir.glob()` method to match all files in the `1-plantar-cara` directory that start with `01-`, `02-`, etc. up to `07-`.
2. We create an empty hash to store the footnotes, with the footnote numbers as keys and the footnote content as values.
3. We iterate over the bibliography file (`1-plantar-cara/08-bibliography.md`) and extract the footnotes by searching for lines that start with `[^`. We use the `split()` method to separate the footnote number from the footnote content, and add the footnote to the hash.
4. We iterate over each file to search, read in the file contents, and replace any references to footnotes using a regular expression. The regular expression matches any string that starts with a left square bracket, followed by any number of spaces, followed by a footnote number, followed by any number of spaces, followed by a right square bracket. We use a block to replace the matched string with the appropriate footnote content, wrapped in parentheses. If the footnote number is not found in the hash, we leave the matched string unchanged.
5. Finally, we write out the updated file contents to the original file.

Note that this script assumes that the footnotes in the other Markdown files are formatted using the same syntax as the bibliography file, i.e. using the `[^number]: content` syntax. If your footnotes are formatted differently, you may need to modify the regular expression used to search for footnote references.

Please correct that regular expression under # Replace any references to footnotes to find something like [^11]

Sure, you can modify the regular expression used to search for footnote references in the following way to match footnotes in the format `[^number]`:

```ruby
content.gsub!(/\[\^(\d+)\]/) do |match|
  number = $1
  if footnotes.key?(number)
    "(#{footnotes[number]})"
  else
    match
  end
end
```

This regular expression matches any string that starts with a left square bracket, followed by a caret symbol (`^`), followed by one or more digits, followed by a right square bracket. We use a block to replace the matched string with the appropriate footnote content, wrapped in parentheses. If the footnote number is not found in the hash, we leave the matched string unchanged.

This is the structure of my hash. I think we need to filter that gsub
{"1"=>"http://bit.ly/2sJG4sH",
 "2"=>"http://bit.ly/2sJGuzh",
 "3"=>"http://bit.ly/2om3j6Z",
 "4"=>"http://bit.ly/2omFE6m",
 "5"=>"http://bit.ly/2sESQcf",
 "6"=>"http://bit.ly/2Ca0I9o",
 "7"=>"http://eluni.mx/2sKJJGW",
 "8"=>"http://bit.ly/2Cc66ce",
 "9"=>"http://bit.ly/2BIiKib",
 "10"=>"http://bit.ly/2omZTkh",

If I understand correctly, you would like to modify the regular expression to only match footnote numbers that exist in the hash. In that case, you can modify the `gsub` method to filter the matches based on whether the footnote number exists in the hash or not. Here's an example of how you can modify the `gsub` method to achieve this:

```ruby
content.gsub!(/\[\^(?<number>\d+)\]/) do |match|
  number = $~[:number]
  if footnotes.key?(number)
    "(#{footnotes[number]})"
  else
    match
  end
end
```

Here, we're using a named capture group to extract the footnote number from the match, and we're checking if the number exists in the `footnotes` hash before replacing the match with the footnote content. If the number is not found in the hash, we leave the match unchanged. This ensures that only valid footnote references are replaced in the target file.

Overleaf won't render my markdown footnote, why? I have used the markdown library

Overleaf is a LaTeX editor, which means that it expects you to write your document in LaTeX syntax rather than Markdown syntax. While Overleaf does have some support for Markdown, it's not a full Markdown renderer, and some Markdown features may not work as expected.

In particular, Markdown footnotes are not a standard LaTeX feature, so they may not be rendered correctly in Overleaf. To use footnotes in Overleaf, you should use the standard LaTeX `\footnote{}` command instead.

If you want to convert your Markdown document to LaTeX syntax, you can use a tool like Pandoc to do so. Pandoc can convert Markdown documents to a variety of formats, including LaTeX. Here's an example command you can use to convert a Markdown document to LaTeX:

```
pandoc input.md -o output.tex
```

This command will convert the Markdown document `input.md` to a LaTeX document `output.tex`. You can then open the `output.tex` file in Overleaf and make any necessary edits to the LaTeX code.
