# JavaScript Transpilation with esbuild

Does esbuild transpile code? How can I find if my js is transpiled?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, `esbuild` can transpile code. It is a fast JavaScript bundler and minifier that supports transforming newer JavaScript syntax to older syntax to ensure compatibility with older browsers. This process is known as transpilation. `esbuild` can handle ES6+ syntax and JSX, among other things, and convert them into a version of JavaScript that can run in environments that do not support the latest features natively.

To find out if your JavaScript code has been transpiled by `esbuild`, you can look for the following indicators:

1. **Check the Output Code**: The easiest way to see if your code has been transpiled is to look at the output code generated by `esbuild`. Transpiled code often looks different from the source code, especially if you're using modern JavaScript features. For instance, ES6 arrow functions might be converted to traditional function expressions, or `const` and `let` declarations might be transformed into `var` declarations.

2. **Configuration File**: If you have access to the `esbuild` configuration, you can check to see which target browsers or JavaScript versions have been specified. `esbuild` uses the `target` option to determine how much it should transpile the code. For example, setting a target of `es6` would not transpile features that are native to ES6 or newer, while setting a target to `es5` would transpile newer syntax to be ES5 compliant.

3. **Check for Polyfills**: Some features cannot be directly transpiled into older JavaScript syntax because they introduce new functionality (like Promises or async/await). In these cases, `esbuild` might include polyfills or transform the code in a way that simulates these features. Checking the output for polyfills or rewritten async functions could indicate transpilation.

4. **Use Source Maps**: If `esbuild` generates source maps alongside the transpiled code, you can use these to compare the original source code to the transpiled code. Source maps allow you to trace the transpiled code back to its original form, which can be particularly useful for debugging or understanding how the code was transformed.

5. **Command Line or API Options**: If you're using `esbuild` through its CLI or API, the options you specify can give you hints about the transpilation process. For example, specifying a `--target=` option with a value that's lower than the syntax level used in your source code would trigger transpilation.

To definitively identify transpilation, comparing the input and output files for syntax changes, especially targeting specific JavaScript versions or features, is key. Additionally, familiarizing yourself with the configuration options that dictate `esbuild`'s behavior can give you a clear insight into its transpilation process.
