# Organizing Files

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

how can I normalize files names in bash? I.e. removing -,  and other elements that could affect regular file parsing activities (like getting the right format for a given filename).

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

You can use bash parameter expansion and tools like `tr` and `sed` to normalize filenames. Here is a simple bash script to rename files in a directory by removing specific characters and replacing spaces with underscores:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *; do
  # Remove leading and trailing whitespace
  newfile="$(echo "$file" | sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//')"

  # Replace spaces with underscores
  newfile="$(echo "$newfile" | tr ' ' '_')"

  # Remove parentheses
  newfile="$(echo "$newfile" | tr -d '()')"

  # Remove commas
  newfile="$(echo "$newfile" | tr -d ',')"

  # Replace hyphens with underscores
  newfile="$(echo "$newfile" | tr '-' '_')"

  # Rename the file
  mv -- "$file" "$newfile"
done
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the transformations being made:

1. **Trim leading and trailing whitespaces**: `sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//'`
2. **Replace spaces with underscores**: `tr ' ' '_'`
3. **Remove parentheses**: `tr -d '()'`
4. **Remove commas**: `tr -d ','`
5. **Replace hyphens with underscores**: `tr '-' '_'`

After running this script, the given example filename:

```
(Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series) Clark, Barrett - Data Visualization Toolkit_ Using JavaScript, Rails, and Postgres to Present Data and Geospatial Information-Pearson Education (2016).azw3
```

Would be changed to:

```
Addison-Wesley_Professional_Ruby_Series_Clark_Barrett_-_Data_Visualization_Toolkit_Using_JavaScript_Rails_and_Postgres_to_Present_Data_and_Geospatial_Information-Pearson_Education_2016.azw3
```

Make sure to test this script with a few sample files first to ensure it behaves as expected, and always keep a backup of your original files before performing batch renaming operations.

If you need to handle more complex transformations or handle a large number of files with different naming patterns, you might need to adjust the script accordingly.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Interview me so you can write some automation rules for my hard drives using organize python library

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Sure, I'd be happy to help you formulate some automation rules! Letâ€™s start with a few questions to better understand your needs:

1. **Types of Files:** What types of files do you mostly have? (e.g., documents, images, videos, etc.)

2. **Naming Conventions:** Do your files follow any specific naming conventions? If so, could you provide some examples?

3. **Directory Structure:** How is your current directory structure organized, and how would you like it to be after automation?

4. **Sorting Criteria:** How would you like your files to be sorted? (e.g., by date, file type, name, etc.)

5. **File Retention:** Are there any old or temporary files that you would like to automatically delete or archive?

6. **Duplicates:** How would you like the script to handle duplicate files?

7. **Logs and Notifications:** Would you like the script to log its actions or notify you about specific events?

8. **Scheduling:** How frequently do you want the automation script to run? (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.)

9. **Backup:** Do you have a backup system in place, or would you like the script to create backups before making changes?

10. **Special Cases:** Are there any specific use cases or special types of files that need custom handling?

These questions should give us a good starting point to draft some automation rules using the `organize` library in Python.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I want to centraIize every doc/html/pptx file to markdown and move original files to a incremental tar zipped archive. Iâ€™d also like to make an automatic criteria for documents classification based on para method (it will help me move everything to obsidian) so it should have some rules to move media to different folders if they have names like project or formats like csv so they always end up in the right place. E.g. files named like project, bookmark, ruby_script, etc. Sorted by date (most recent first),  of course cleanup all empty folders (attempting to reduce tree branching to the bare minimum to prevent Windows issues). Now focus in the hard drive cleanup but remind me to tell you about Downloads and chrome history folder in my mac for a second interview. These rules I will simulate them and will be run once but the later will use scheduling. The script should create backups before making changes.

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Thank you for sharing your requirements. Based on your description, here are some steps and rules you might implement using the `organize` library and other Python tools:

1. **Centralize Documents:**
   - Scan for all `.doc`, `.html`, and `.pptx` files.
   - Convert each file to Markdown format. Tools like `pandoc` can be useful for this.
   - Move the original files to an incremental tar zipped archive. The archive can be named based on the current date and time to avoid overwriting.

2. **Document Classification:**
   - Use the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for organizing files.
   - Classify documents based on filename patterns (e.g., files named `project`, `bookmark`, `ruby_script`, etc.) and move them to the appropriate folders.
   - For media files, establish rules to move them to specific folders based on their format and name.

3. **Sorting and Cleanup:**
   - Sort files by date with the most recent first.
   - Cleanup all empty folders to reduce tree branching.

4. **Backups:**
   - Before making any changes, create backups of the original files and folder structure.

5. **Scheduling and Simulation:**
   - Initially, simulate the rules to ensure they behave as expected.
   - The rules for hard drive cleanup will be run once, but others might use scheduling for periodic organization.

In a follow-up conversation, we can explore additional requirements related to your Downloads folder, Chrome history folder, and any scheduling needs.

For scripting, `organize` for file organization, `pandoc` for document conversion, and Pythonâ€™s `shutil` and `os` libraries for file operations will be particularly useful. Given the complexity, developing and testing the script in stages is advisable to ensure each part works as intended before moving to the next.

Would you like more detailed assistance with writing specific parts of the script or any clarification on the proposed solution?

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Show me the code for my hdd file automation rules

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Creating a script to automate all of your requirements is quite complex and involves multiple stages and tools. Below is a high-level overview and some snippets to get you started. Since the task is quite extensive, I recommend breaking it down and tackling each part separately.

### 1. Convert Documents to Markdown

You can use `pandoc` to convert documents to Markdown. Below is a simple example of how you might call `pandoc` from a Python script using the `subprocess` module:

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Find all .doc, .html, .pptx files in the specified directory
for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('/path/to/your/files'):
    for filename in filenames:
        if filename.endswith(('.doc', '.html', '.pptx')):
            filepath = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
            output_filepath = os.path.splitext(filepath)[0] + '.md'
            subprocess.run(['pandoc', filepath, '-o', output_filepath])
```

### 2. Archive Original Files

After converting, you can archive the original files:

```python
import shutil
import time

# Create a timestamped archive name
archive_name = f"archive_{int(time.time())}.tar.gz"
shutil.make_archive(archive_name, 'gztar', '/path/to/your/files', '*.doc *.html *.pptx')
```

### 3. Organize Files

For organizing files according to names and moving them to different folders, you can use a combination of string matching and shutil.move:

```python
import shutil

# Define your organizing rules
rules = {
    'project': '/path/to/projects',
    'bookmark': '/path/to/bookmarks',
    'ruby_script': '/path/to/scripts',
}

# Apply rules
for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('/path/to/your/files'):
    for filename in filenames:
        for rule, dest_folder in rules.items():
            if rule in filename.lower():
                shutil.move(os.path.join(foldername, filename), os.path.join(dest_folder, filename))
```

### 4. Sort Files by Date and Clean Empty Directories

```python
import os

# Sort files in each folder by date
for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('/path/to/your/files', topdown=False):
    files = [os.path.join(foldername, f) for f in filenames]
    files.sort(key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True)  # Sort by modification time

    # Optionally move, rename, or delete files here

    # Remove empty folders
    if not os.listdir(foldername):
        os.rmdir(foldername)
```

### 5. Backup

Before running these scripts, ensure you have a backup mechanism in place. You can use cloud solutions, external hard drives, or other backup solutions suitable for your setup.

These are simplified snippets to give you a starting point. Depending on your exact folder structure, naming conventions, and other specifics, you might need to adapt them. Also, this does not cover every requirement you mentioned, but should help you get started on creating the full script. Test thoroughly on a small, backed-up dataset before applying broadly.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I expected the yml you get after organize edit

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The `organize` tool uses YAML configuration files to define rules for organizing files. However, it has some limitations, and not all of your requirements can be achieved directly using `organize`. Hereâ€™s a simplified example to give you an idea of how you might start structuring your `config.yaml` file for `organize`.

```yaml
rules:

  # Move specific files to designated folders
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension:
        - doc
        - html
        - pptx
      filename:
        contains: project
    actions:
      - move: ~/Projects/{filename}
  
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension:
        - doc
        - html
        - pptx
      filename:
        contains: bookmark
    actions:
      - move: ~/Bookmarks/{filename}

  # ... add more rules for other filenames and formats like csv

  # Remove empty folders
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      type: folder
      empty: true
    actions:
      - delete
```

This YAML file outlines some basic rules for organizing your files using `organize`. The `move` action is used to move the matching files to their respective folders based on their filenames. There is also a rule to delete empty folders.

However, note that:

- The `organize` tool does not have built-in support for converting files to different formats or creating archives.
- Handling more complex tasks like sorting by date, creating backups, and specific document classification may require additional scripting or tools outside of `organize`.

Remember to adjust the folder paths and rule criteria according to your actual requirements and folder structure. Additionally, due to the limitations of the `organize` tool for this specific task, combining it with additional Python scripting or shell commands may be necessary to achieve all your goals.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Assume the scripts exist and reference them by their ideal names, I want the most completed version of the yml

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Understood. Assuming you have already created necessary scripts, here's a more complete `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
rules:

  # Convert Documents to Markdown and Archive Originals
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension:
        - doc
        - html
        - pptx
    actions:
      - shell: convert_to_markdown_and_archive.sh {path}

  # Move Specific Files to Designated Folders
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension: md
      filename:
        contains: project
    actions:
      - move: ~/Projects/{filename}
  
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension: md
      filename:
        contains: bookmark
    actions:
      - move: ~/Bookmarks/{filename}

  # Move CSV files to a specific folder
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension: csv
    actions:
      - move: ~/CSVs/{filename}
  
  # Sort files by date and cleanup
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      extension: md
    actions:
      - shell: sort_by_date_and_cleanup.sh {path}

  # Remove Empty Folders
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      type: folder
      empty: true
    actions:
      - delete

  # Create Backups before Making Changes
  - folders: ~/path/to/your/files
    subfolders: true
    actions:
      - shell: create_backup.sh {path}
```

In this YAML file, various `shell` actions are used to call your hypothetical scripts like `convert_to_markdown_and_archive.sh`, `sort_by_date_and_cleanup.sh`, and `create_backup.sh`. These scripts are assumed to handle the conversion of documents to Markdown, archiving of original files, sorting files by date, cleanup of the directory, and creating backups.

Remember, `organize` runs the rules in the order they are defined in the `config.yaml` file, so ensure that they are in the correct order, especially the backup rule.

This example assumes that you have the necessary permissions to execute these scripts and that they are in your `PATH`. Make sure to test each script independently to confirm that they work as expected before integrating them with `organize`.
