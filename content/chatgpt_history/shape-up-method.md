Shape Up Method from Basecamp



The Shape Up method, developed by Basecamp, is a product development framework designed to help teams build and ship projects more effectively. Hereâ€™s an overview of the core concepts of the Shape Up method:

### Core Concepts

1. **Shaping Work**: This involves defining what needs to be done before handing it off to the development team. Shaping includes tasks like setting boundaries, rough solutions, and identifying risks. It's usually done by senior members or product managers.

2. **Betting Table**: This is where decisions are made about which shaped work will be prioritized and taken on by the team. The betting table involves key stakeholders who decide what projects to work on for the next cycle.

3. **Six-Week Cycles**: Work is done in six-week cycles, which are followed by two-week cool-down periods. This rhythm allows for focused work periods and time for review, learning, and planning the next cycle.

4. **Appetite**: Instead of estimating how long something will take, the team decides how much time theyâ€™re willing to spend on a particular task. This constraint helps in focusing efforts and preventing projects from dragging on indefinitely.

5. **Hill Charts**: These are used for tracking progress visually. The hill chart reflects the concept of uphill and downhill work, where uphill work involves unknowns and problem-solving, while downhill work is more straightforward execution.

6. **No Backlogs**: Shape Up discourages maintaining long lists of tasks or backlogs. Instead, it focuses on clear, current priorities, avoiding the maintenance of large, often irrelevant, to-do lists.

7. **Hand-off to Small Teams**: Once work is shaped and approved, small, autonomous teams of designers and developers take ownership of the projects. These teams have the freedom to decide how to achieve the set goals within the given constraints.

### Process Steps

1. **Shaping**:
   - **Pitching**: Ideas are proposed with clear problem definitions and possible solutions.
   - **Bounding**: Setting boundaries to prevent scope creep.
   - **Rough Sketching**: Providing a high-level overview without detailed specifications.

2. **Betting**:
   - **Betting Table Meeting**: Stakeholders meet to review pitches and decide on the projects for the next cycle.
   - **Deciding**: The chosen projects are the ones the team will work on for the next six weeks.

3. **Building**:
   - **Team Formation**: Small teams are formed with clear goals and autonomy.
   - **Execution**: Teams work on the projects, focusing on completing the work within the six-week timeframe.
   - **Hill Charts**: Progress is tracked using hill charts to identify and address unknowns early.

4. **Cooldown**:
   - **Review**: After six weeks, the cycle ends with a review of what was accomplished.
   - **Reflecting and Planning**: Teams reflect on the past cycle and prepare for the next, utilizing the two-week cooldown period for planning, bug fixes, and minor improvements.

### Benefits

- **Focus and Clarity**: Clear boundaries and well-defined projects help teams stay focused and avoid scope creep.
- **Predictability**: The six-week cycles provide a predictable rhythm, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
- **Empowerment**: Small teams with autonomy can make quick decisions and adapt to challenges more effectively.
- **Reduced Waste**: By avoiding extensive backlogs and focusing on current priorities, teams can reduce the waste associated with managing long lists of tasks.

The Shape Up method is particularly well-suited for teams looking for a structured yet flexible approach to product development, providing a balance between planning and execution.
