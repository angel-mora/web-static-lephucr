ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To update `stylelint` in a project that uses Yarn as its package manager, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the current version of `stylelint`**:
   First, you might want to check which version of `stylelint` you're currently using. You can do this by looking at the `package.json` file in your project directory or by running:

   ```
   yarn list stylelint
   ```

2. **Determine the version to update to**:
   Before updating, you might want to see what versions are available. You can check the latest versions of `stylelint` on the npm package page or by running:

   ```
   yarn info stylelint versions
   ```

3. **Update `stylelint`**:
   - To update `stylelint` to the latest version, you can run:

     ```
     yarn upgrade stylelint --latest
     ```

   - If you want to update to a specific version of `stylelint`, specify the version like so:

     ```
     yarn add stylelint@<version>
     ```
     Replace `<version>` with the desired version number.

4. **Verify the update**:
   After updating, you can verify that `stylelint` has been updated to the desired version by running:

   ```
   yarn list stylelint
   ```

5. **Test your project**:
   It's important to test your project after updating dependencies to ensure everything works as expected. Run your project's test suite, and manually test functionalities as necessary.

6. **Commit the changes**:
   If you're using version control (like git), remember to commit the updated `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files to your repository.

This process will update `stylelint` in your project to the latest or a specific version, ensuring you have the most recent features and bug fixes. Always refer to the `stylelint` release notes or documentation for information on breaking changes or migration steps for major version updates.
