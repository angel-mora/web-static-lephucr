Can I also use obsidian publish and lock access to my website under my nextjs app?

Yes, you can use Obsidian Publish and lock access to your website under your Next.js app. Here‚Äôs how you can integrate Obsidian Publish with a Next.js app and add authentication to control access:

### Steps to Integrate Obsidian Publish with Next.js

1. **Setup Obsidian Publish**:
   - First, you need to publish your Obsidian notes using Obsidian Publish. Follow the [official documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish) to set up and publish your notes.

2. **Create a Next.js App**:
   - Initialize a new Next.js project if you don‚Äôt already have one:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest my-obsidian-site
     cd my-obsidian-site
     ```

3. **Proxy Obsidian Publish in Next.js**:
   - You can proxy your Obsidian Publish site within your Next.js app. This can be done using the `next.config.js` file:
     ```javascript
     // next.config.js
     module.exports = {
       async rewrites() {
         return [
           {
             source: '/notes/:path*',
             destination: 'https://publish.obsidian.md/your-site-name/:path*' // Proxy to Obsidian Publish
           }
         ];
       },
     };
     ```

4. **Implement Authentication**:
   - To lock access, you can implement authentication using a service like NextAuth.js or a custom authentication mechanism. Here‚Äôs an example using NextAuth.js:
     ```bash
     npm install next-auth
     ```

   - Configure NextAuth.js in your Next.js app:
     ```javascript
     // pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
     import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
     import Providers from 'next-auth/providers';

     export default NextAuth({
       providers: [
         Providers.Google({
           clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
           clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
         }),
         // Add more providers here
       ],
       // Additional configuration
     });
     ```

   - Protect your pages using the `useSession` hook from NextAuth.js:
     ```javascript
     // pages/notes/[...slug].js
     import { getSession, useSession } from 'next-auth/client';

     export default function NotePage({ slug }) {
       const [session, loading] = useSession();

       if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

       if (!session) {
         return <div>You need to be authenticated to view this page.</div>;
       }

       return (
         <iframe
           src={`https://publish.obsidian.md/your-site-name/${slug}`}
           style={{ width: '100%', height: '100vh', border: 'none' }}
         />
       );
     }

     export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
       const session = await getSession(context);

       if (!session) {
         return {
           redirect: {
             destination: '/api/auth/signin',
             permanent: false,
           },
         };
       }

       const { slug } = context.params;

       return {
         props: {
           slug: slug.join('/'),
         },
       };
     }
     ```

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure you have your environment variables set up for authentication providers in a `.env.local` file:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
     GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
     NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

### Summary
- **Obsidian Publish**: Use it to publish your notes.
- **Next.js App**: Create and configure a Next.js app.
- **Proxying**: Proxy your Obsidian Publish site within Next.js.
- **Authentication**: Use NextAuth.js to add authentication and protect access.

This setup allows you to integrate your Obsidian Publish site within a Next.js app and restrict access to authenticated users.

Will that make the url still available publicly?

Yes, using the method

Using the proxy method described above will still leave the original Obsidian Publish URL publicly accessible, as it doesn't inherently protect the source URL itself. To fully protect your content and ensure it's not publicly accessible, you need to implement additional access control measures directly on the Obsidian Publish side or through a more secure setup. Here are a couple of alternative approaches:

### 1. Use Server-Side Authentication and Proxy

Set up a server-side proxy with authentication checks before forwarding requests to Obsidian Publish. This way, only authenticated users can access the content.

#### Steps:
1. **Set Up a Custom Proxy Server**:
   - Use a server framework like Express.js to create a proxy server that handles authentication and forwards requests to Obsidian Publish.

2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Use an authentication middleware to protect routes on your proxy server.

3. **Proxy Requests to Obsidian Publish**:
   - Only authenticated requests will be forwarded to the Obsidian Publish URL.

#### Example:
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');
const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

const app = express();

// Configure Passport
passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
  clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
  callbackURL: "/auth/google/callback"
},
(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  return done(null, profile);
}));

passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser((obj, done) => {
  done(null, obj);
});

// Express session
app.use(session({ secret: 'secret', resave: false, saveUninitialized: true }));
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

// Authentication routes
app.get('/auth/google', passport.authenticate('google', { scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login'] }));
app.get('/auth/google/callback', passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/' }), (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/');
});

// Middleware to check if user is authenticated
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/auth/google');
}

// Proxy middleware
app.use('/notes', ensureAuthenticated, createProxyMiddleware({
  target: 'https://publish.obsidian.md/your-site-name',
  changeOrigin: true,
  pathRewrite: { '^/notes': '' }
}));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### 2. Self-Host the Obsidian Vault

Instead of using Obsidian Publish, you can host your Obsidian vault on your server with better control over access and authentication.

#### Steps:
1. **Export Obsidian Vault**:
   - Export your Obsidian vault to a static site generator like Next.js or Gatsby.

2. **Host the Static Site**:
   - Deploy this site on a platform where you can implement access control, such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or a custom server.

3. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Use a solution like NextAuth.js for authentication and restrict access to the static site.

### Summary

1. **Proxy with Server-Side Authentication**:
   - Create a custom proxy server that handles authentication and forwards requests to Obsidian Publish.

2. **Self-Host with Authentication**:
   - Export your Obsidian vault to a static site generator and host it with access control.

Both methods ensure that your content is only accessible to authenticated users and not publicly available.

The error you are encountering indicates that there is an issue with the SQLite database already having a table named `tags`. This can be resolved by modifying the script to check if the table exists before attempting to create it, or by deleting the existing database file to reset it.

Here are steps you can follow to resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Remove the Existing SQLite Database
If you don't need to keep the current data in your SQLite database, you can delete the database file. This will reset the database and allow the script to create the necessary tables without conflicts.

1. Locate the SQLite database file, which is usually named `database.sqlite` or similar, in your project directory.
2. Delete the database file. You can do this through the terminal or your file explorer.

For example, if your database file is located in a directory called `data`, you can run the following command:
```bash
rm ./data/database.sqlite
```

### Step 2: Modify the Script to Check for Existing Tables
If you prefer to keep your existing data and prevent this error in the future, modify the script to check if the table exists before trying to create it. Here is an example of how you can adjust your script to check for the existence of the table:

1. Open the script file `./scripts/prebuild.mjs` in your code editor.
2. Modify the part of the script that creates the `tags` table to check if the table already exists.

Example modification:
```javascript
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
const db = new sqlite3.Database('./data/database.sqlite');

db.serialize(() => {
  db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tags (
    name VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (name)
  )`);
});

db.close();
```

### Step 3: Rerun the Development Server
After deleting the existing database or modifying the script, rerun the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure you have all necessary permissions to delete the database file or modify the script.
- Make sure no other process is using the SQLite database while you are trying to delete it.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `SQLITE_ERROR` and successfully run the development server for Flowershow.
