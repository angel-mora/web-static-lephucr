ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Fix the following Google query
domain:thenewcentre.org Kanye West

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To improve the Google search query for finding information about Kanye West specifically within the domain of thenewcentre.org, you can modify the query as follows:

```
site:thenewcentre.org Kanye West
``` 

This revised query uses the `site:` operator to restrict the search results to pages from thenewcentre.org that mention Kanye West.
