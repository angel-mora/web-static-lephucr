Script to create videos out of blog posts, ruby and python, use existing libraries 

Creating videos from blog posts is a multi-step process. Here's a high-level approach using Ruby and Python:

1. **Extract Text from Blog Posts**: This can be done using a web scraper, like Nokogiri in Ruby.
2. **Text to Speech**: Convert the extracted text to audio. Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly can be used.
3. **Generate Visual Content**: You might use static images, or dynamically generated slides with key points from the blog.
4. **Combine Audio and Visuals**: Combine the audio and visual content to create a video.

Here's a basic outline:

### 1. Ruby: Extract Text from Blog Posts with Nokogiri

```ruby
require 'open-uri'
require 'nokogiri'

def extract_text_from_blog(url)
  doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))
  # Assuming the main content is within <article> tags. Adjust as per your website structure.
  content = doc.css('article').text.strip
  content
end

blog_url = "YOUR_BLOG_POST_URL"
text_content = extract_text_from_blog(blog_url)
File.write('blog_content.txt', text_content)
```

### 2. Python: Text-to-Speech using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API

```python
from google.cloud import texttospeech

def text_to_speech(text_file, output_file):
    client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

    with open(text_file, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=text)
    voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
        language_code="en-US",
        ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.NEUTRAL)

    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3)

    response = client.synthesize_speech(
        input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config)

    with open(output_file, 'wb') as out:
        out.write(response.audio_content)

text_to_speech('blog_content.txt',
