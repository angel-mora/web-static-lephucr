**Conversation Title: Vim**

The comparison between Neovim (nvim) and Vim can be subjective and depends on what users prioritize in a text editor. Here's a brief overview that might help:

1. **Features**: Neovim aims to improve upon Vim by refactoring the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend. Some new features are added in Neovim that don't exist in Vim, while others might be implemented more elegantly or efficiently.

2. **Configuration and Plugins**: Neovim has an increased focus on extensibility and aims to make it simpler to write and use plugins. If you're interested in customization, this might be seen as an improvement over Vim.

3. **Learning Curve**: Neovim doesn't fundamentally change the key commands or editing philosophy of Vim, so if you find Vim difficult to use, you'll likely find Neovim to be similarly challenging. Some improvements in Neovim may make certain tasks more intuitive, but the core experience is similar.

4. **Compatibility**: Neovim aims to be compatible with most Vim plugins, but not all might work flawlessly. If you rely on specific Vim plugins, you might want to check their compatibility with Neovim first.

5. **Community and Support**: As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, both Vim and Neovim have strong communities, but the direction and focus might vary.

In summary, whether Neovim is "easier" than Vim might depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are comfortable with Vim, transitioning to Neovim should be relatively straightforward, and you might find some aspects of it more appealing or convenient. If you are new to both, the differences in difficulty may be minimal, and exploring both might be the best way to decide which one suits you better.
