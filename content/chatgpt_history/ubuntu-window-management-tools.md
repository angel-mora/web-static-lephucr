Equivalent of Rectangle panes admin but for Ubuntu



For Ubuntu, the equivalent of **Rectangle** (a popular window manager for macOS that allows you to organize and snap windows) is a tiling window manager or a similar window management tool. Some options include:

1. **Gnome's Built-in Tiling & Shortcut Features** (Default in Ubuntu):
   - Ubuntu's default Gnome desktop environment already includes basic window snapping features (dragging to the edges or using keyboard shortcuts like `Super` + `Arrow keys`).
   - For more advanced shortcuts and window resizing, you can configure the Gnome Shell with the **Gnome Tweaks** tool.

2. **Pop!_OS Window Tiling** (COSMIC Desktop):
   - If you're looking for a more sophisticated tiling experience, **Pop!_OS** (based on Ubuntu) has a built-in tiling window feature. You can install this on regular Ubuntu as well.
   
   Install using:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76/pop
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install pop-shell
   ```

3. **QuickTile**:
   - A lightweight window snapping app for Ubuntu. It allows you to define keyboard shortcuts for snapping windows into different parts of the screen, much like Rectangle.

   Install using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install quicktile
   ```

4. **KWin (KDE)**:
   - If you're using KDE Plasma, **KWin** is a great alternative. It offers customizable window snapping and tiling options. You can define shortcuts or use mouse gestures to manage windows.

5. **i3wm / Regolith**:
   - If you want a true tiling window manager experience, **i3** or **Regolith** (an Ubuntu-based i3 distribution) could be the way to go. They offer full tiling management and customizable configurations but require more setup and learning.

These tools will provide different levels of window management, depending on your preferences for customization and ease of use.

If I am using a Ubuntu instance inside a Mac through AWS Workspace, what is the most suitable option? Don't want conflicts between Mac and Ubuntu

User is using an Ubuntu instance inside a Mac through AWS Workspace.

Model set context updated.

In your case, since you're running Ubuntu within AWS Workspace on a Mac, you want to avoid conflicts between the Mac's native window management and Ubuntu's window manager. The best option would be a tool that doesn't interfere with macOS and remains isolated within your Ubuntu session. Here are two suggestions:

1. **QuickTile**:
   - This tool is lightweight and simple. It doesnâ€™t require any drastic changes to your window management, and itâ€™s perfect for use in an isolated Ubuntu instance. You can easily set keyboard shortcuts for managing window layouts, and it will only apply inside your Ubuntu environment without affecting macOS.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install quicktile
   ```

2. **Pop!_OS Tiling**:
   - If you want more advanced tiling features, **Pop!_OS Shell** could be a good fit. It provides a tiling experience in Ubuntu that is non-invasive to macOS. Since this would run within the AWS Workspace environment, it wonâ€™t create conflicts with macOS's native behavior.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76/pop
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install pop-shell
   ```

Both options are suitable for keeping the window management within Ubuntu without affecting your Macâ€™s window manager.
