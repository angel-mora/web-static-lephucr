ü§ñ **Assistant:**

Becoming a good leader and advancing in your career as a senior Rails developer, especially when dealing with ADHD and seeking to improve focus and handle frustration better, involves a multi-faceted approach. Here are strategies encompassing leadership, technical skill enhancement, and cognitive-behavioral techniques to help you progress:

### Leadership Skills
1. **Emotional Intelligence (EI):** Develop your EI by practicing self-awareness, empathy, and relationship management. This helps in understanding team dynamics and leading effectively.
2. **Communication:** Enhance your ability to communicate clearly and listen actively. This involves not just speaking but also effectively conveying ideas through writing and presentations.
3. **Delegate and Trust:** A good leader knows when to delegate tasks and trusts their team to deliver. This also involves empowering your team members by providing them with opportunities to grow.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Leadership requires staying updated on industry trends, technology, and management practices. Engage in lifelong learning through courses, reading, and networking.

### Technical Skill Enhancement
1. **Mentorship:** Seek a mentor who has a strong background in Rails and leadership. This could be someone within your organization or from the broader tech community.
2. **Code Review:** Actively participate in code reviews to understand different approaches and improve your coding style. Reviewing others' code can also be a learning opportunity.
3. **Project Management:** Understanding the bigger picture of project management, including agile methodologies, can help you lead projects more effectively.
4. **Problem-Solving:** Improve your problem-solving skills by practicing with real-world problems. Websites like LeetCode or HackerRank can be useful, but also consider contributing to open source projects.

### Cognitive-Behavioral Strategies
1. **Structured Problem-Solving:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This can help reduce the overwhelm and frustration when facing difficult bugs or system issues.
2. **Mindfulness and Stress Management:** Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine to improve focus and reduce impulsivity. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or even short walks can help.
3. **Time Management:** Use tools and techniques to manage your time effectively, such as the Pomodoro Technique, which can also help in taking regular breaks to manage dopamine levels healthily.
4. **Seek Professional Support:** Consider working with a psychologist or therapist who specializes in ADHD and cognitive-behavioral strategies to develop personalized strategies for managing distractions and enhancing focus.

### Addressing Specific Challenges
- **Dopamine Regulation:** Finding healthy alternatives for dopamine regulation is crucial. Consider engaging in regular exercise, pursuing hobbies that bring you joy, and establishing a rewarding system for completing tasks that aligns with your long-term goals.
- **Frustration with Bugs:** Develop a systematic approach to debugging. Document your hypotheses, test them one by one, and keep a log of what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Sometimes stepping away for a bit can provide a new perspective.
- **Environmental Optimization:** Since you have a good ergonomic setup, continue to optimize your environment for focus. This might include noise-cancelling headphones, using apps that limit distractions, or creating a visual workflow on your wall.

Remember, leadership and technical skills go hand in hand with personal development. Your journey to improving as a developer and leader is ongoing, and every step forward counts. Celebrate your progress and remain patient and persistent with your growth.

How can I create a light routine that helps me avoid triggers ans have periods of deep focus? Then, provide common weed-pmo triggers I should be aware of and sustitutions (like playing Civ 6 or doing something less intense)?
I'd like to also decrease the intense of my dopamine rewards. Like the microdosing idea but for dopamine detox

Creating a light routine that minimizes triggers and fosters periods of deep focus involves structuring your day in a way that supports your cognitive and emotional needs while gradually reducing reliance on high-dopamine activities. Here‚Äôs a simple structure to consider:

2. **Light Exercise:** Engage in light exercise like a short walk, yoga, or stretching to boost your mood and energy naturally.
3. **Healthy Breakfast:** Eat a nutritious breakfast that
