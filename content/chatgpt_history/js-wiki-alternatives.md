üôã **You:**

any of them have support for wikilinks and can show wikilink graphs like in obsidian?

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

Yes, **Wiki.js** and **Docusaurus** have some degree of support for **Wikilinks** and graph visualizations, though it may require plugins or additional configurations. If you want functionality similar to **Obsidian**'s graph view and Wikilink handling, here are the top options:

---

## 1. **Obsidian Publish (Closest to Obsidian)**
- **Overview**: While not open-source, **Obsidian Publish** is a paid, hosted service that lets you publish your Obsidian vault (supports wikilinks, graphs, etc.).
- **Graph View**: Exactly like Obsidian's graph view.
- **Wikilinks**: Full support for Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]`.
- **Customization**: Can customize appearance and links through CSS.

**Why Consider**: If you need seamless **Obsidian functionality** online without rebuilding it, this is the best.

- **Website**: [https://obsidian.md/publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)

---

## 2. **Docusaurus + Wikilink Plugin**
- **Wikilink Support**: You can extend Docusaurus with a Markdown plugin to parse and resolve `[[wikilinks]]`.
   - Example: `remark-wiki-link` (or custom MDX plugins).
- **Graph Visualization**: You can integrate **Obsidian-like graph views** using:
   - **Graphlib** or **Cytoscape.js** for dynamic, interactive graph views.
   - Use **markdown-it** parsers to connect pages and visualize links.

**How**:
1. Use the `remark-wiki-link` plugin to parse and render wikilinks.
2. Use Cytoscape.js or similar libraries to render the graph visualization.

**Why Consider**: Highly customizable, modern, React-based framework.

- **Website**: [https://docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io)

---

## 3. **Wiki.js + Wikilink Support**
- **Wikilink Support**: Built-in **Markdown** rendering does not natively support `[[wikilinks]]`. You can:
   - Extend it with a **custom parser** or JavaScript plugin.
   - Convert wikilinks to standard Markdown `[Link](page.md)`.
- **Graph View**: You can integrate graph libraries like **Graphviz** or **Cytoscape.js** to render relationships visually.

**Why Consider**: Flexible and powerful for self-hosted setups.

- **Website**: [https://js.wiki](https://js.wiki)

---

## 4. **Foam (VSCode-Based Obsidian Alternative)**
- **Overview**: Foam is an open-source second-brain tool that works in VSCode and supports:
   - Full **Obsidian-like Wikilinks** (`[[link]]`).
   - Markdown note graph visualizations.
- **Graph View**: Built-in graph visualization via extensions like **Graph Visualizer**.
- **Git Integration**: All content is Git-backed.

**Why Consider**: Foam integrates deeply into VSCode and is ideal for local workflows.

üôã **You:**

So if I want my rails app to publish the website for my users from git and let them edit it over the web ui as well, should I use Docusaurus + Cytoscape/TinaCMS or go straight to Gollum? I'm creating an mvp

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

If you're building an **MVP** where your Rails app:

1. Publishes websites for users based on **Git-backed content**.
2. Allows users to **edit content via a web UI**.

Here's a clear recommendation based on priorities:

---

### **Straight to Gollum for MVP**  
**Why?**
- **Simplicity**: Gollum is Git-native and provides a ready-to-use web UI for editing content.  
- **Fast Setup**: Gollum integrates easily into a Rails app because it uses Rack, a common Ruby middleware.  
- **Minimal Development Effort**: You get web-based editing and publishing out-of-the-box.  

**Pros of Gollum**:
- Lightweight and easy to deploy alongside Rails.  
- Users can edit their content directly using a clean web interface.  
- Git handles the version control transparently.  

**Cons of Gollum**:
- The UI is basic and might not look modern enough for a polished MVP.  
- Limited extensibility compared to JavaScript-based frameworks like Docusaurus.

---

### **Docusaurus + TinaCMS for the Future**
If you're aiming for a **highly modern and extensible solution** but willing to invest **more development time**, then:

1. Use **Docusaurus** to publish the content as a static website.  
2. Integrate **TinaCMS** (or a similar headless CMS) for inline editing directly on the web.  
3. Use Rails to **orchestrate** the Git workflow and manage user permissions.

**Pros of Docusaurus + TinaCMS**:
- Fully modern **React-based** stack.  
- Provides inline editing (users see changes live).  
- You can customize the editing experience and add features like **graphs** (via Cytoscape.js).  
- Excellent for scaling beyond an MVP.

**Cons**:
- Requires **significant development effort** to integrate Docusaurus/TinaCMS with Rails.  
- Inline editing and Git management add complexity.  

---

### **Decision Path**

- **For a Simple MVP (Fastest Path)**:  
   Use **Gollum**. Focus on providing a functional editing and publishing system. It‚Äôs minimal, Git-based, and integrates smoothly with Rails.  

- **For Long-Term Scalability**:  
   Use **Docusaurus + TinaCMS** for a modern UI and inline editing, but start simple by just orchestrating content with Git and Rails.  

---

### Final MVP Recommendation: **Start with Gollum**  

1. Integrate Gollum into your Rails app as a mounted Rack middleware for editing.
2. Let Rails handle user authentication and permissions to restrict Gollum access.  
3. Rails can serve the content or generate static HTML from Git for the published site.  

Once your MVP gains traction, you can consider migrating to a **Docusaurus/TinaCMS** setup for a polished, scalable product.

üôã **You:**

Does Gollum handle frontmatter for configuration as Jekyll does?

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

No, **Gollum** does not natively handle **frontmatter** (like Jekyll, which processes YAML frontmatter for configurations such as titles, tags, or layouts). Gollum primarily focuses on rendering Markdown, Textile, and other text formats as a Git-backed wiki with a web editor. It doesn‚Äôt process or parse frontmatter for configuration purposes out-of-the-box.

---

### **How Gollum Handles Content**:
- It directly renders file formats like **Markdown** or other supported syntaxes.
- There is no inherent mechanism for treating **YAML frontmatter** as metadata.

---

### **Solutions to Use Gollum with Frontmatter**:

If you need frontmatter support (like Jekyll), here are some approaches:

1. **Custom Rendering Plugins**:
   - Gollum allows you to extend its rendering pipeline using **custom plugins**.
   - You can write a plugin to parse YAML frontmatter and handle the metadata before rendering.
   - Use libraries like `yaml` or `kramdown` for parsing.

   Example plugin workflow:
   - Read the file content.
   - Extract YAML frontmatter from the top of the file.
   - Pass the rest of the content to Gollum‚Äôs Markdown renderer.

---

2. **Pre-process Files with Frontmatter**:
   - Use a **build step** or background job to strip YAML frontmatter from content files before displaying them in Gollum.
   - Store the metadata elsewhere (e.g., a separate JSON/YAML config file or database).

---

3. **Consider Alternatives (If Frontmatter Is Critical)**:
   - Tools like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, or **Docusaurus** handle frontmatter natively and integrate it into static site generation.  
   - For a web-editable Git-based CMS with frontmatter support, consider **Netlify CMS** or **Forestry.io**.

---

### **Summary**:
- Gollum does **not** support YAML frontmatter natively.
- You can extend Gollum‚Äôs functionality with **custom plugins** to handle frontmatter.
- For a more straightforward solution where frontmatter is critical, use tools like **Jekyll**, **Docusaurus**, or other static site generators.
