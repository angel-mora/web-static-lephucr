ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Gmail and Outlook both have rules to better manage emails? What other general tips do you have for most of commercial smtp clients? Tags? Or those are only in Gmail?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Gmail and Outlook both offer rules or filters to manage emails efficiently. Many commercial email clients have similar features. Here are some general tips that apply to most of them:

1. **Filters/Rules**: Use filters to automatically sort, label, or forward emails based on specific criteria like sender, subject, or keywords.

2. **Folders/Labels**: Organize emails into folders (Outlook) or use labels (Gmail) to categorize emails for easy retrieval.

3. **Priority Inbox/Focused Inbox**: Use features like Gmail's Priority Inbox or Outlook's Focused Inbox to highlight important emails.

4. **Archiving**: Instead of deleting, archive emails to declutter your inbox while retaining the ability to access old emails.

5. **Search Functionality**: Utilize advanced search options to quickly find emails by date, sender, keywords, etc.

6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn keyboard shortcuts for common tasks to save time.

7. **Snooze Emails**: Use the snooze function to temporarily remove emails from your inbox and have them reappear at a more convenient time.

8. **Integration with Calendar and Tasks**: Take advantage of integrations with calendar and task management tools within the email client.

9. **Unsubscribe from Unwanted Emails**: Regularly unsubscribe from newsletters or promotions you no longer read.

10. **Use Multiple Accounts**: If applicable, use separate email accounts for different purposes (e.g., work, personal, subscriptions).

11. **Email Signatures**: Set up professional email signatures for your outgoing emails.

12. **Spam Filters**: Regularly check and adjust spam filters to ensure important emails arenâ€™t missed.

13. **Read Receipts and Delayed Send**: Use read receipts for important emails and delayed send options to schedule when an email should be sent.

14. **Attachment Reminders**: Some clients have a feature to remind you if it seems like you've forgotten to attach a file.

15. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security with two-factor authentication.

Each email client has its unique set of features, so it's a good idea to explore the settings and options available in your specific client.
