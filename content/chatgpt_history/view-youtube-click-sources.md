Yes, you can see where your YouTube video traffic is coming from using YouTube Analytics. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Sign in to YouTube Studio:**
   - Go to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/) and sign in with your account.

2. **Access Analytics:**
   - In the left-hand menu, click on "Analytics."

3. **Traffic Sources:**
   - In the Analytics dashboard, navigate to the "Reach" tab.
   - Here, you will see various reports about your traffic sources.

4. **External Traffic Sources:**
   - Under the "Traffic source types" section, you will find "External" which shows the sources outside of YouTube.
   - Click on "See More" under "External" to view detailed information about which websites or platforms your viewers are coming from, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.

5. **Sharing Services:**
   - Additionally, under "Traffic source: External," you can see specific details of the platforms if viewers are coming from social media, search engines, or other websites.

These analytics will give you a clear picture of where your video traffic is coming from, helping you to understand and optimize your promotional strategies.
