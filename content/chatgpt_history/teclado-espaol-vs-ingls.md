The issue lies in how macOS interprets key bindings for different keyboard layouts. When you switch between Spanish and English layouts, the key mapping changes, affecting shortcuts like `Cmd + '`. Here's how you can address this issue:

---

### **Solution: Remap the Shortcut for Switching Windows**

1. **Go to System Preferences:**
   - Open **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** in newer macOS versions).
   - Navigate to **Keyboard > Shortcuts**.

2. **Find the App Windows Shortcut:**
   - In the sidebar, select **Keyboard > App Shortcuts** or **Keyboard > Mission Control** (depending on macOS).
   - Look for the shortcut related to **Switch windows of the same application**.

3. **Remap the Shortcut:**
   - Select the shortcut and click to edit.
   - Press a key combination that works universally across your keyboards (e.g., `Cmd + Option + Tab` or a similar unused combination).

4. **Test the Shortcut:**
   - Use the newly mapped shortcut on both Spanish and English layouts to ensure consistency.

### **Alternative Solution: Use Keyboard Mapping Tools**
If you prefer to keep the `Cmd + '` shortcut for the Spanish layout but adapt it for the English layout:

1. **Use Karabiner-Elements:**
   - Download and install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
   - Create a custom key mapping to remap the English layout's apostrophe key to match your desired shortcut.

2. **Create a Profile for the English Keyboard:**
   - In Karabiner-Elements, set up a profile specifically for the English keyboard layout.
   - Map the **apostrophe key** (`Option + ]`) to directly trigger `Cmd + '`.

---

### **Why Does This Happen?**
- On the Spanish keyboard layout, the apostrophe (`'`) is directly accessible, allowing `Cmd + '` to work seamlessly.
- On the English keyboard layout, the apostrophe requires a combination (`Option + ]`), which macOS doesn't recognize as the same key in the shortcut.
