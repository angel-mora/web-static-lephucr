How can I create a rails app on top of a quartz instance?



If you want to build a **Ruby on Rails app on top of a Quartz instance**, you likely mean one of two things:

1. **Quartz Scheduler** (Java-based job scheduling system)
2. **Quartz DB/Infrastructure** (e.g., using Notion-like Quartz as a CMS or Markdown-based site)

Which one are you referring to?

a Obsidian Publish like CMS

If you want to build a **Rails CMS on top of a Quartz instance** (like **Obsidian Publish**), here’s a structured approach:

---

### **1. Understanding Quartz as a Backend**
Quartz ([quartz.jzhao.xyz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)) is a static site generator that turns a folder of **Markdown files** into a website. It’s built on **Next.js** and uses Markdown as the content source.

Since Quartz is a static site, your Rails app would need to:
- **Read** Markdown content from a folder/repo (or API, if extended).
- **Edit** Markdown content (if you want a CMS-like experience).
- **Render** or sync updates dynamically.

---

### **2. Architecture of the Rails App**
#### **Option A: Rails as a Git-Based CMS**
- Store Markdown files in a **Git repository** (e.g., using `rugged` or `git` commands).
- Rails provides a UI for editing content.
- When saved, Rails **commits & pushes** updates to the Quartz repository.

#### **Option B: Rails as a File-Based CMS**
- Markdown files are stored in the Rails **filesystem**.
- Rails serves them through a custom API.
- Quartz periodically fetches updates.

#### **Option C: Rails with a DB-Backed Markdown API**
- Store Markdown in **PostgreSQL/SQLite** as a `text` field.
- A Quartz-compatible **exporter** generates the Markdown files.
- Sync logic ensures the Rails DB and the Markdown files stay in sync.

---

### **3. Implementation Details**
#### **1. Reading Markdown Content**
Use [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) or [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) to parse Markdown.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'

markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML)
content = File.read("path/to/note.md")
html = markdown.render(content)
```

#### **2. Writing Markdown Files**
```ruby
File.write("path/to/note.md", "# New Title\n\nUpdated content here...")
```

#### **3. Git Integration for Syncing (Optional)**
```ruby
system("git add . && git commit -m 'Updated content' && git push origin main")
```

#### **4. Serving Content via API (if needed)**
A Rails controller could expose Markdown data for Quartz:
```ruby
class NotesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    content = File.read("path/to/#{params[:id]}.md")
    render json: { content: content }
  end
end
```

---

### **4. Deployment and Hosting**
- **Local Development:** Run Rails alongside Quartz (`rails s` + `npm run dev` in Quartz).
- **Production:** Host Rails on **Fly.io/Render** + Quartz on **Vercel/Netlify**.
- **Automation:** Use GitHub Actions to sync content updates.

---

### **5. Next Steps**
- Would you like Quartz to remain **fully static** or integrate dynamic Rails rendering?
- Do you need **authentication & user roles** for content management?
- Would you prefer a **web-based editor** or just sync files via Git?

Let me know what works best for your project! 🚀

I just want to implement a paywall and keep all the markdown content in the quartz folder as it is

If you want to **implement a paywall** while keeping all your Markdown content inside the **Quartz folder**, the best approach is to use **Rails for authentication & payment management** and let Quartz handle content rendering.

---

## **💡 Approach: Rails as a Paywall Proxy**
Since Quartz serves Markdown as static files, the simplest way to implement a paywall is by **blocking direct access to certain files** and routing requests through Rails.

### **🔧 Steps to Implement the Paywall**
#### **1. Move Quartz Behind Rails**
- Instead of serving Quartz directly, let **Rails act as a reverse proxy**.
- Rails will **check authentication/payment** before serving Markdown files.

#### **2. Restrict Access to Paid Content**
- Store metadata (e.g., **which Markdown files are behind the paywall**) in Rails.
- When a user requests a page:
  - Rails **verifies their subscription**.
  - If valid → Serve the file.
  - If not → Redirect to payment.

#### **3. Integrate Stripe for Payments**
- Use [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) to handle subscriptions.
- Store payment status in Rails.
- Only allow access to files **if the user has an active subscription**.

---

## **🔨 Implementation**
### **1. Protecting Access in Rails**
Modify **routes.rb** to intercept requests:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/notes/:filename", to: "paywall#serve_markdown"
end
```

Create **paywall_controller.rb**:
```ruby
class PaywallController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user! # Devise or custom auth

  def serve_markdown
    # Check if file is behind paywall
    filename = params[:filename]
    if paywalled?(filename) && !current_user.paid?
      redirect_to new_payment_path, alert: "Subscribe to access this content."
      return
    end

    # Serve Markdown file from Quartz folder
    markdown_path = Rails.root.join("quartz/content", "#{filename}.md")
    if File.exist?(markdown_path)
      send_file markdown_path, type: "text/markdown", disposition: "inline"
    else
      render plain: "File not found", status: :not_found
    end
  end

  private

  def paywalled?(filename)
    # Define which files require a subscription
    %w[premium-article-1 premium-article-2].include?(filename)
  end
end
```

---

### **2. Handling Payments with Stripe**
#### **Subscription Model**
Generate a `Subscription` model:
```sh
rails g model Subscription user:references status:string stripe_customer_id:string
rails db:migrate
```

Set up the Stripe API:
```ruby
Stripe.api_key = ENV["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"]
```

Create **PaymentsController**:
```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.create(
      payment_method_types: ["card"],
      mode: "subscription",
      line_items: [{
        price: ENV["STRIPE_PRICE_ID"],
        quantity: 1
      }],
      success_url: dashboard_url,
      cancel_url: root_url
    )

    redirect_to session.url, allow_other_host: true
  end
end
```

---

### **3. Deploying Everything**
1. **Run Rails on Fly.io/Render** to handle authentication/paywall.
2. **Deploy Quartz on Vercel/Netlify**.
3. **Set Up Nginx (Optional):** If you want Rails to fully control Quartz, use **Nginx as a reverse proxy** to forward requests.

---

## **✅ Summary**
- **Rails:** Handles authentication + payment.
- **Quartz:** Still serves the Markdown content.
- **Paywall Logic:** Rails intercepts requests and checks if users are subscribed.
- **Stripe Checkout:** Handles payments.

This keeps the Quartz structure **untouched** while adding a **Rails-powered paywall**. 🚀 Would this solution work for you?

I want a better tutorial. Like in which folder will my quartz app live and a tutorial on how to do it from start

Got it! You want a **detailed step-by-step tutorial** on how to integrate a **paywall in a Rails app while keeping Quartz unchanged**. Here’s the **complete setup guide**, assuming you're starting from scratch.  

---

# **🚀 Goal: Add a Paywall to Quartz with Rails**
We'll create a Rails app to **manage user authentication and payments**. Quartz will remain a static site, but its **Markdown files will be protected**, requiring users to log in and subscribe.

## **📌 Overview of the Architecture**
- **Rails (Backend)** → Manages users, subscriptions, and authentication.
- **Quartz (Static Site)** → Stores and renders Markdown files.
- **Paywall Mechanism** → Rails serves protected Markdown files from Quartz.

---

## **1️⃣ Setting Up the Project**
### **Step 1: Create a New Rails App**
First, install Rails and create a new project:
```sh
rails new quartz-paywall --database=postgresql
cd quartz-paywall
```
**Install Devise for authentication**:
```sh
bundle add devise
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
rails db:migrate
```
This will create a **User model** with authentication.

---

### **Step 2: Install Stripe for Payments**
Add Stripe to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'stripe'
```
Run:
```sh
bundle install
```
Set up Stripe in an initializer:
```sh
# config/initializers/stripe.rb
Stripe.api_key = ENV["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"]
```
**Create a subscription model**:
```sh
rails g model Subscription user:references status:string stripe_customer_id:string
rails db:migrate
```
This will track **which users have an active subscription**.

---

## **2️⃣ Setting Up Quartz**
### **Step 3: Install Quartz in the Rails App**
Since Quartz is a static site generator, you need to **keep it inside your Rails project**.

```sh
cd quartz-paywall
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
mv quartz quartz-site
```
Now, your project structure should look like this:
```
quartz-paywall/
│── app/
│── config/
│── quartz-site/   <-- Quartz lives here!
│── db/
│── public/
│── Gemfile
│── ...
```
---

### **Step 4: Make Rails Serve Markdown Files**
Modify **routes.rb** to intercept requests:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/notes/:filename", to: "paywall#serve_markdown"
  devise_for :users
end
```
Create **PaywallController**:
```sh
rails g controller Paywall
```
Edit **app/controllers/paywall_controller.rb**:
```ruby
class PaywallController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def serve_markdown
    filename = params[:filename]

    if paywalled?(filename) && !current_user.subscribed?
      redirect_to new_payment_path, alert: "Subscribe to access this content."
      return
    end

    markdown_path = Rails.root.join("quartz-site/content", "#{filename}.md")
    if File.exist?(markdown_path)
      send_file markdown_path, type: "text/markdown", disposition: "inline"
    else
      render plain: "File not found", status: :not_found
    end
  end

  private

  def paywalled?(filename)
    %w[premium-article-1 premium-article-2].include?(filename)
  end
end
```
---

## **3️⃣ Implementing Payments**
### **Step 5: Create Stripe Checkout**
Create a **PaymentsController**:
```sh
rails g controller Payments
```
Edit **app/controllers/payments_controller.rb**:
```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.create(
      payment_method_types: ["card"],
      mode: "subscription",
      line_items: [{
        price: ENV["STRIPE_PRICE_ID"],
        quantity: 1
      }],
      success_url: dashboard_url,
      cancel_url: root_url
    )

    redirect_to session.url, allow_other_host: true
  end
end
```
Add a **user subscription check** in the User model:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :subscription

  def subscribed?
    subscription&.status == "active"
  end
end
```
---

### **Step 6: Protect Quartz Static Files**
Modify **quartz-site/next.config.js** (if using Next.js Quartz) to **disable direct access**:
```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/content/:path*",
        destination: "http://localhost:3000/notes/:path*", // Redirect to Rails
        permanent: false,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```
This ensures **all Markdown requests go through Rails**.

---

## **4️⃣ Running the Project**
### **Step 7: Start Rails**
```sh
rails s
```
### **Step 8: Start Quartz**
```sh
cd quartz-site
npm install
npm run dev
```
Now:
- Public content loads normally.
- Paywalled content redirects to the **Rails paywall**.

---

## **✅ Summary**
| Component  | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Rails** | Handles authentication, payments, and serves protected Markdown. |
| **Quartz** | Renders Markdown files but defers paywalled content to Rails. |
| **Stripe** | Manages subscriptions and payments. |

This setup **keeps Quartz unchanged** while using Rails to protect premium content. 🚀 Let me know if you need refinements!

 and how to deploy to heroku?

## **🚀 Deploying Rails + Quartz Paywall to Heroku**
To deploy your **Rails paywall app** to **Heroku** while keeping Quartz static, follow this guide.

---

## **1️⃣ Preparing Your Rails App for Heroku**
### **Step 1: Add PostgreSQL & Buildpacks**
Heroku uses **PostgreSQL** by default, so ensure your `Gemfile` includes:
```ruby
gem 'pg'
```
Then run:
```sh
bundle install
```

### **Step 2: Update `config/database.yml` for Production**
Modify the **production** section:
```yaml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Stripe ENV Variables**
Since Heroku uses **environment variables**, set them in your terminal:
```sh
heroku config:set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
heroku config:set STRIPE_PRICE_ID=your_price_id
```
(Optional: Set up with Heroku’s UI under **Settings > Config Vars**.)

---

### **Step 4: Precompile Assets**
Before pushing to Heroku, run:
```sh
rails assets:precompile
```
To automate this, add to **package.json** (if using Webpacker):
```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "rails assets:precompile"
}
```

---

### **Step 5: Create and Push to Heroku**
Initialize a **Git repo** if you haven’t:
```sh
git init
heroku create your-app-name
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push heroku main
```

Run migrations:
```sh
heroku run rails db:migrate
```

---

## **2️⃣ Deploying Quartz to Vercel or Netlify**
### **Step 6: Deploy Quartz Separately**
Since Quartz is a static site, it’s best to deploy it using **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

#### **Option A: Deploy to Vercel**
1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```sh
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Link Quartz:
   ```sh
   cd quartz-site
   vercel
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to deploy.

#### **Option B: Deploy to Netlify**
1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```sh
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```
2. Deploy:
   ```sh
   cd quartz-site
   netlify deploy
   ```

---

## **3️⃣ Connecting Quartz with Rails**
### **Step 7: Redirect Requests to Rails**
Modify **`quartz-site/next.config.js`** (if using Next.js Quartz):
```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/content/:path*",
        destination: "https://your-heroku-app.herokuapp.com/notes/:path*",
        permanent: false,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```
This ensures **paywalled content routes through Rails**.

---

## **4️⃣ Final Testing**
### ✅ **Test the Following:**
- **Public content** loads directly from Quartz.
- **Paywalled content** requires login.
- **Stripe payments** work.
- **New users** can register.

---

## **5️⃣ Automate Deployment with GitHub**
For continuous deployment:
```sh
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
git push heroku main
```
For Quartz:
- Use **Vercel's GitHub integration** to auto-deploy changes.

---

## **🔥 Done!**
Now, you have:
- **Rails on Heroku** (handling auth + paywall).
- **Quartz on Vercel/Netlify** (for static content).
- **Paywall enforcement through Rails**.

Would you like a **GitHub Actions script** to automate deployment? 🚀

Why would I need to deploy to two different servers?

You **don’t necessarily need two deployments**, but keeping Rails and Quartz **separate** offers benefits like **scalability and performance**. However, if you want to deploy **everything on Heroku**, you can do so. Here's a breakdown of both approaches:

---

## **🏗 Option 1: Separate Deployments (Recommended)**
### **Why?**
- **Performance**: Static sites (like Quartz) are optimized for **CDN delivery** (Netlify/Vercel), while Rails is better for **dynamic logic**.
- **Scalability**: If your Rails app **gets slow**, you don’t want it to slow down your Markdown site.
- **Simpler Routing**: Quartz stays independent and can be used with or without the paywall.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Free-tier hosting for Quartz on Vercel/Netlify.

---

## **🏗 Option 2: Deploy Everything on Heroku (One Server)**
### **How?**
- Deploy Quartz **inside Rails’ `public/` folder**.
- Use Rails to serve the Quartz **static files** and add a paywall.

---

## **🚀 Deploying Quartz Inside Rails (Single Heroku App)**
### **1️⃣ Move Quartz to Rails' `public/` Folder**
If your Quartz app is currently **outside Rails**, move it inside:
```sh
mv quartz-site public/quartz
```
Your folder structure:
```
quartz-paywall/
│── app/
│── config/
│── db/
│── public/
│   ├── quartz/  <-- Quartz lives here
│── Gemfile
│── ...
```

### **2️⃣ Serve Quartz from Rails**
Modify **`routes.rb`**:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/notes/:filename", to: "paywall#serve_markdown"
  devise_for :users

  # Serve static Quartz files
  get "/*path", to: "static_files#serve"
end
```

Create a **StaticFilesController** to serve Quartz:
```sh
rails g controller StaticFiles
```
Edit **app/controllers/static_files_controller.rb**:
```ruby
class StaticFilesController < ApplicationController
  def serve
    file_path = Rails.root.join("public/quartz", params[:path])

    if File.exist?(file_path)
      send_file file_path, disposition: "inline"
    else
      render plain: "Not found", status: :not_found
    end
  end
end
```
---

### **3️⃣ Deploy Rails + Quartz to Heroku**
#### **Add Buildpacks**
Since Heroku serves static assets differently, add the Node.js buildpack:
```sh
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

#### **Precompile Quartz for Heroku**
If your Quartz app requires a build step (like Next.js), update **`package.json`** inside `quartz-site/`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "npm install && npm run build"
}
```
Then, in **Rails’ `Procfile`**, add:
```
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
release: rails db:migrate
```

#### **Deploy**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Deploying Rails + Quartz to Heroku"
git push heroku main
heroku run rails db:migrate
```

---

## **✅ Done!**
Now:
- Rails serves **Quartz** (`public/quartz/`).
- **Paywall logic** runs in Rails (`/notes/:filename`).
- Everything is deployed **on a single Heroku app**.

Would you like to **optimize caching** to make it load faster? 🚀

So what would be the best approach if I want Quartz to be updated from Obsidian over Github Actions but still have the Rails endpoints available? I'd also like to be able to abstract my rails app to generate multiple Quartz instance for multiple users?

## **Best Approach for Multi-Tenant Quartz + Rails with GitHub Actions**  
Since you want:  
1. **Quartz updates from Obsidian via GitHub Actions** ✅  
2. **Rails endpoints available for authentication & paywall** ✅  
3. **Multi-user support, each with their own Quartz instance** ✅  

The best approach is **a hybrid setup**:  
- **Quartz (static site) deployed to Vercel/Netlify**, auto-updated via **GitHub Actions**.  
- **Rails (paywall & multi-tenancy) deployed to Heroku**, serving protected Markdown.  
- **A Rails API & webhooks** to manage multi-user Quartz instances.

---

# **🛠️ Architecture Overview**
### **1️⃣ Quartz Deployment (One Per User)**
Each user gets their own Quartz instance deployed to **Vercel/Netlify**:  
- GitHub Actions triggers Quartz deployment **when they update Obsidian**.  
- Each instance is stored in a `users/username` folder in a **monorepo**.  
- Users edit Markdown in Obsidian → Push to GitHub → Quartz deploys automatically.  

### **2️⃣ Rails Backend for Authentication & Paywall**
- **Handles user logins & subscriptions** (Devise + Stripe).  
- **Manages multiple Quartz instances** by associating users with their GitHub repositories.  
- **Acts as a content proxy** for paywalled pages, redirecting users to the correct Quartz instance.

---

## **🏗 How to Build It**
### **1️⃣ Multi-User Quartz Structure**
You’ll use a **monorepo** to store user-specific Quartz sites:  
```
quartz-repo/
│── users/
│   ├── user1/
│   │   ├── content/  
│   │   ├── quartz-config/
│   ├── user2/
│   ├── user3/
│── .github/workflows/
│── ...
```
Each user has a separate **Quartz folder**, and GitHub Actions deploys their site.

---

### **2️⃣ Rails App: Multi-Tenant System**
Modify your **User model** in Rails:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :quartz_instance

  def quartz_url
    "https://#{username}.vercel.app" # User-specific Quartz URL
  end
end
```
Add a **QuartzInstance model** to track deployments:
```sh
rails g model QuartzInstance user:references repo_url:string deploy_url:string
rails db:migrate
```
---

### **3️⃣ Protecting Content with Rails**
#### **🔒 Middleware to Enforce Paywall**
Intercept Markdown requests:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/notes/:user/:filename", to: "paywall#serve_markdown"
  devise_for :users
end
```
Controller:
```ruby
class PaywallController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def serve_markdown
    user = User.find_by(username: params[:user])
    filename = params[:filename]

    if user.nil? || (paywalled?(filename) && !user.subscribed?)
      redirect_to new_payment_path, alert: "Subscribe to access this content."
      return
    end

    markdown_url = "#{user.quartz_url}/#{filename}.md"
    redirect_to markdown_url
  end

  private

  def paywalled?(filename)
    %w[premium-article-1 premium-article-2].include?(filename)
  end
end
```
✅ **User gets redirected to their private Quartz site**.

---

### **4️⃣ Automate Quartz Deployment with GitHub Actions**
Inside `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy Quartz Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Quartz dependencies
        run: cd users/${{ github.actor }} && npm install && npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: cd users/${{ github.actor }} && vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
✅ This deploys a **Quartz site for each user** when they update Obsidian.

---

### **5️⃣ Connecting Rails & GitHub Actions**
When a user **signs up**, Rails should **create a new Quartz repo**:
```ruby
class QuartzInstance < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  after_create :setup_github_repo

  def setup_github_repo
    # Call GitHub API to create a new user folder in the monorepo
    # Trigger the GitHub Action to deploy Quartz
  end
end
```
✅ This ensures that **each new user gets their own Quartz site**.

---

## **🚀 Final Deployment**
1. **Deploy Rails on Heroku**:
   ```sh
   git push heroku main
   heroku run rails db:migrate
   ```
2. **Deploy Quartz to Vercel** using GitHub Actions.
3. **Test**:
   - User signs up → Gets a Quartz instance.
   - If **not subscribed**, content is blocked.
   - If **subscribed**, they can read **their Quartz notes**.

---

## **🔥 Why This is the Best Approach**
✅ **Scales for multiple users** (each user has their own Quartz instance).  
✅ **Automates Obsidian to Quartz updates** via GitHub Actions.  
✅ **Keeps Rails lean** (just authentication + paywall, no Quartz rendering).  
✅ **Fast & cost-effective** (Quartz on Vercel, Rails on Heroku).  

Would you like me to add **GitHub API integration** for automatic repo setup? 🚀

how do I make sure the quartz site is not directly available in the clients url?

To prevent users from directly accessing their **Quartz site URL** (e.g., `user123.vercel.app`), you can use one of these approaches:

---

## **🔒 1. Restrict Direct Access via HTTP Authentication**
You can configure **Vercel/Netlify** to **require authentication** before serving any content.  

### **🛠 Vercel Approach**
In `vercel.json`, add:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": {
        "x-vercel-protection": "1"
      },
      "dest": "/401.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
Now, only requests from **authenticated sources** (your Rails app) will work.

---

## **🔒 2. Serve Content via Rails (Proxy Requests)**
Instead of letting users access `user123.vercel.app` directly, **proxy requests through Rails**.

### **🛠 Steps**
1. **Block public access** in Quartz.
2. **Only allow Rails to fetch content**.
3. **Serve content via Rails** (`https://yourapp.com/notes/:filename`).

### **Modify Quartz to Block Direct Access**
Inside `next.config.js` (Quartz config):
```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        headers: [
          { key: "X-Robots-Tag", value: "noindex, nofollow" },
          { key: "Cache-Control", value: "no-store" }
        ]
      }
    ];
  }
};
```
🔒 This **blocks indexing** and **prevents caching**.

---

### **🛠 Modify Rails to Serve Content**
In `routes.rb`:
```ruby
get "/notes/:filename", to: "paywall#serve_markdown"
```
In **`paywall_controller.rb`**:
```ruby
class PaywallController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def serve_markdown
    user = current_user
    filename = params[:filename]

    if user.nil? || (paywalled?(filename) && !user.subscribed?)
      redirect_to new_payment_path, alert: "Subscribe to access this content."
      return
    end

    # Fetch the Markdown from Quartz
    quartz_url = "https://#{user.username}.vercel.app/#{filename}.md"
    response = RestClient.get(quartz_url, headers: { Authorization: "Bearer #{ENV['RAILS_SECRET_KEY']}" })

    if response.code == 200
      render plain: response.body
    else
      render plain: "Not Found", status: :not_found
    end
  end

  private

  def paywalled?(filename)
    %w[premium-article-1 premium-article-2].include?(filename)
  end
end
```
✅ **Users can’t access the Quartz site directly, only via Rails**.

---

## **🔒 3. Restrict Access Using Vercel Environment Variables**
In **Vercel**, set an **environment variable**:
```sh
VERCEL_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```
Modify `next.config.js` in Quartz:
```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        has: [
          { type: "header", key: "Authorization", value: "Bearer your-secret-token" }
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/401.html"
      }
    ];
  }
};
```
✅ Now **only requests from Rails (with a secret token) can access content**.

---

### **🚀 Final Setup**
1. **Quartz is deployed on Vercel** but **blocks public access**.
2. **Rails handles authentication** and **proxies content**.
3. **Only Rails requests can reach Quartz**.

Would you like to add **token-based auth for extra security**? 🚀

Just provide the best comprehensive tutorial for the needs I just mentioned. I want to be able to create multiple quartz instances associated to a gh repo each but to make it accesible only through the rails app. Provide the most security compliant and scalable solution. Evaluate if a Rails monolith could be the option. Try as much as you can to make that your solution relies in code configs and less parties involved so hosting is simple and as cheap as possible

Got it! You need a **scalable, secure, and cost-efficient** solution where:  
- **Each user gets a Quartz instance** linked to their own GitHub repo.  
- **Quartz content is accessible only through the Rails app** (no direct public access).  
- **Minimal third-party services** to keep hosting simple and cheap.  
- **A Rails monolith** (if viable) to centralize logic.  

---

## **🏗 Recommended Architecture: Self-Contained Rails Monolith**
✅ **Rails serves Quartz content dynamically** (no separate hosting on Vercel).  
✅ **Multi-tenancy: each user has their own Quartz repo**.  
✅ **GitHub Actions auto-deploys Quartz markdown** to the Rails server.  
✅ **Rails controls access and serves Markdown securely**.  

---

## **🛠 Step 1: Project Structure**
Your Rails app will:  
1. **Clone & sync Quartz repositories** locally.  
2. **Store Quartz sites inside `storage/quartz/:username`**.  
3. **Serve Quartz pages dynamically** through Rails controllers.  

### **📁 Folder Structure**
```
rails-app/
│── app/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── paywall_controller.rb
│   │   ├── quartz_controller.rb
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── user.rb
│   │   ├── quartz_instance.rb
│── config/
│── db/
│── storage/
│   ├── quartz/      # Each user's Quartz repo is cloned here
│   │   ├── user1/
│   │   ├── user2/
│── scripts/
│   ├── sync_quartz.sh   # GitHub Action will call this script
```
✅ **Keeps everything in one Rails monolith**.

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Multi-Tenant Quartz Management**
Each user has a **QuartzInstance** model:  

### **Create Quartz Instance Model**
```sh
rails g model QuartzInstance user:references repo_url:string local_path:string
rails db:migrate
```
### **app/models/quartz_instance.rb**
```ruby
class QuartzInstance < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  after_create :clone_repo

  def clone_repo
    repo_name = repo_url.split("/").last.gsub(".git", "")
    local_path = Rails.root.join("storage", "quartz", user.username)

    # Clone repo if it doesn't exist
    unless Dir.exist?(local_path)
      system("git clone #{repo_url} #{local_path}")
    end

    update(local_path: local_path.to_s)
  end

  def sync_repo
    system("cd #{local_path} && git pull origin main")
  end
end
```
✅ When a user signs up, **their Quartz repo is cloned** into `storage/quartz/:username`.

---

## **🛠 Step 3: Securely Serving Quartz Content**
Instead of deploying Quartz on Vercel, Rails **serves pages dynamically** from the stored repo.

### **Routes (config/routes.rb)**
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users

  get "/notes/:filename", to: "quartz#serve_markdown"
end
```

### **Controller (app/controllers/quartz_controller.rb)**
```ruby
class QuartzController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def serve_markdown
    user = current_user
    filename = params[:filename]

    quartz_instance = user.quartz_instance
    markdown_path = File.join(quartz_instance.local_path, "content", "#{filename}.md")

    unless File.exist?(markdown_path)
      return render plain: "Not found", status: :not_found
    end

    # Send Markdown content to user
    send_file markdown_path, disposition: "inline", type: "text/markdown"
  end
end
```
✅ **Users can only access their own Quartz notes via Rails**.  

---

## **🛠 Step 4: Automating Quartz Updates with GitHub Actions**
Whenever a user **updates their Obsidian notes**, GitHub should **sync changes with Rails**.

### **GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`)**
```yaml
name: Sync Quartz Content

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify Rails Server
        run: |
          curl -X POST "$RAILS_SERVER_URL/api/sync_quartz" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILS_SECRET_KEY"
```

### **Rails Sync Endpoint (`app/controllers/api_controller.rb`)**
```ruby
class ApiController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_webhook!

  def sync_quartz
    User.all.each do |user|
      user.quartz_instance.sync_repo
    end
    render json: { message: "Quartz content updated" }
  end

  private

  def authenticate_webhook!
    unless request.headers["Authorization"] == "Bearer #{ENV['RAILS_SECRET_KEY']}"
      render json: { error: "Unauthorized" }, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
end
```
✅ **When a user pushes to GitHub, Rails auto-syncs their Quartz content**.

---

## **🛠 Step 5: Deploying Rails Monolith**
### **1️⃣ Install System Dependencies**
Since Rails serves Markdown, install:
```sh
sudo apt-get install pandoc git
```

### **2️⃣ Deploy to Heroku**
```sh
heroku create my-quartz-app
git push heroku main
heroku run rails db:migrate
```
✅ **Now Rails handles everything: Quartz storage, paywall, and security**.

---

## **🔒 Security Measures**
1. **No Public URLs** → Quartz content **only served via Rails**.  
2. **Webhook Authentication** → Only GitHub can trigger updates.  
3. **Scoped Access** → Users can only access their own Quartz content.  
4. **GitHub Secrets** → Store `RAILS_SECRET_KEY` in GitHub settings.  

---

## **🚀 Final Summary**
| Feature | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| **Hosting** | Rails Monolith (no external services) |
| **Quartz Storage** | Stored in `storage/quartz/:username` |
| **Markdown Access** | Served dynamically via Rails controller |
| **Multi-Tenancy** | Each user gets a separate Quartz instance |
| **Syncing** | GitHub Actions triggers Rails sync |
| **Security** | No direct Quartz access, authentication enforced |

✅ **A self-contained Rails monolith that manages Quartz for multiple users.**  
Would you like extra features like **caching** or **analytics**? 🚀

Would it be super hard to implement a wall of recommended articles? Users would allow public articles via frontmatter config in each markdown article

No, it wouldn’t be super hard! You can implement a **"Recommended Articles"** wall by parsing frontmatter in each Quartz markdown file. Here’s a solid plan:

---

## **🛠 Step 1: Add Frontmatter in Markdown Articles**
Users will add metadata in their Quartz Markdown files like this:

```md
---
title: "How to Build a Rails Paywall"
description: "A guide on securing content in a Rails app."
tags: ["rails", "paywall", "quartz"]
public: true
---
# How to Build a Rails Paywall

This is a tutorial on setting up a paywall...
```
✅ **If `public: true`**, the article is shown on the "Recommended Articles" wall.

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Parse Frontmatter in Rails**
We'll extract metadata from each Quartz markdown file and store it in the database.

### **Add a Model for Public Articles**
```sh
rails g model PublicArticle user:references title:string description:string tags:text filename:string
rails db:migrate
```

### **Modify `QuartzInstance` to Extract Metadata**
Use the `front_matter_parser` gem to read metadata:

#### **Gemfile**
```ruby
gem 'front_matter_parser'
```
Run `bundle install`.

#### **app/models/quartz_instance.rb**
```ruby
require 'front_matter_parser'

class QuartzInstance < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :public_articles, dependent: :destroy

  def sync_public_articles
    markdown_files = Dir.glob("#{local_path}/content/**/*.md")

    markdown_files.each do |file_path|
      content = File.read(file_path)
      parsed = FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse(content)

      next unless parsed.front_matter["public"]

      article = public_articles.find_or_initialize_by(filename: File.basename(file_path, ".md"))
      article.update(
        title: parsed.front_matter["title"],
        description: parsed.front_matter["description"],
        tags: parsed.front_matter["tags"]
      )
    end
  end
end
```
✅ **Whenever Quartz syncs, it extracts public articles and stores them**.

---

## **🛠 Step 3: Show Recommended Articles in Rails**
### **Create a Controller for Public Articles**
#### **app/controllers/public_articles_controller.rb**
```ruby
class PublicArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = PublicArticle.includes(:user).order(created_at: :desc)
  end
end
```

### **Define Route**
#### **config/routes.rb**
```ruby
get "/recommended", to: "public_articles#index"
```

### **Create a Simple View**
#### **app/views/public_articles/index.html.erb**
```erb
<h1>Recommended Articles</h1>

<% @articles.each do |article| %>
  <div class="article-card">
    <h2><%= link_to article.title, notes_path(filename: article.filename) %></h2>
    <p><%= article.description %></p>
    <p>By <%= article.user.username %></p>
    <p>Tags: <%= article.tags.join(", ") %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```
✅ **Now `/recommended` will display all public articles**.

---

## **🛠 Step 4: Automate Metadata Updates**
Each time Quartz syncs, update public articles:

#### **Modify `sync_quartz` in `api_controller.rb`**
```ruby
def sync_quartz
  User.all.each do |user|
    user.quartz_instance.sync_repo
    user.quartz_instance.sync_public_articles
  end
  render json: { message: "Quartz content updated" }
end
```
✅ **Every GitHub push updates the list of public articles**.

---

### **🚀 Final Setup**
- Users **mark articles as public** in their markdown files.
- Quartz **syncs Markdown via GitHub Actions**.
- Rails **parses metadata and updates the database**.
- A **Recommended Articles page** displays all public articles.

You forgot to add a step to create a quartz instance if it doesn't exist in the pulled repo. You should be aware that those instances should get built separately as static websites so they are available publicly as well. I dont see when you are building quartz for each repo and please also explain how if each storage/quartz/:username/:instance would have their own assets and if those could be served within our general rails assets?

Setting Up the Rails 8 App**\n\n### **Create a New Rails 8 App**\n```sh\nrails new quartz_cms --database=postgresql\ncd quartz_cms\n```\n\n### **Add Required Gems**\n#### **Gemfile**\n```ruby\ngem 'devise'               # User authentication\ngem 'front_matter_parser'  # Extract metadata from Markdown\ngem 'pg'                   # PostgreSQL database\ngem 'pundit'               # Authorization\ngem 'fileutils'            # File management\n```\n```sh\nbundle install\n```\n\n### **Install Devise for Authentication**\n```sh\nrails generate devise:install\nrails generate devise User\nrails db:migrate\n```\n\n---\n\n## **2. Managing Multi-Tenant Quartz Repositories**\n\n### **Generate a QuartzInstance Model**\n```sh\nrails g model QuartzInstance user:references repo_url:string local_path:string\nrails db:migrate\n```\n\n### **app/models/quartz_instance.rb**\n```ruby\nrequire 'fileutils'\nrequire 'front_matter_parser'\n\nclass QuartzInstance < ApplicationRecord\n  belongs_to :user\n\n  after_create :setup_quartz\n\n  def setup_quartz\n    repo_name = repo_url.split(\"/\").last.gsub(\".git\", \"\")\n    base_path = Rails.root.join(\"storage\", \"quartz\", user.username)\n    self.local_path = File.join(base_path, repo_name)\n\n    unless Dir.exist?(local_path)\n      system(\"git clone #{repo_url} #{local_path}\")\n    end\n\n    create_quartz_if_missing\n    build_quartz_site\n    update(local_path: local_path.to_s)\n  end\n\n  def sync_repo\n    system(\"cd #{local_path} && git pull origin main\")\n    create_quartz_if_missing\n    build_quartz_site\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def create_quartz_if_missing\n    quartz_config = File.join(local_path, \"quartz.config.js\")\n    unless File.exist?(quartz_config)\n      default_config = \"module.exports = { siteName: '#{user.username}' }\"\n      File.write(quartz_config, default_config)\n    end\n  end\n\n  def build_quartz_site\n    build_path = File.join(local_path, \"public\")\n    FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)\n    system(\"cd #{local_path} && npm install && npm run build\")\n  end\nend\n```\n✅ **Each user's Quartz repo is cloned, updated, and built into a static site.**\n\n---\n\n## **3. Serving Static Quartz Sites Securely**\n\n### **Routes (config/routes.rb)**\n```ruby\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  devise_for :users\n  get \"/:username/:instance/*path\", to: \"quartz#serve_site\"\nend\n```\n\n### **Controller (app/controllers/quartz_controller.rb)**\n```ruby\nclass QuartzController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :authenticate_user!\n\n  def serve_site\n    user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])\n    return render plain: \"User not found\", status: :not_found unless user\n\n    quartz_instance = user.quartz_instance\n    return render plain: \"Quartz instance not found\", status: :not_found unless quartz_instance\n\n    file_path = File.join(quartz_instance.local_path, \"public\", params[:path])\n    return render plain: \"Not found\", status: :not_found unless File.exist?(file_path)\n\n    send_file file_path, disposition: \"inline\"\n  end\nend\n```\n✅ **Each user's Quartz static site is served within Rails, behind authentication.**\n\n---\n\n## **4. Handling Quartz Assets in Rails**\n\n### **Symlink Quartz Assets to Rails Public Folder**\nIn `config/initializers/quartz_assets.rb`, add:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.after_initialize do\n  User.all.each do |user|\n    user.quartz_instance&.sync_repo\n    user.quartz_instance&.build_quartz_site\n\n    quartz_public_path = user.quartz_instance&.local_path.to_s + \"/public\"\n    rails_public_path = Rails.root.join(\"public\", \"quartz\", user.username)\n\n    unless File.exist?(rails_public_path)\n      FileUtils.ln_sf(quartz_public_path, rails_public_path)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n✅ **This ensures that Quartz sites are accessible as `/quartz/:username/...` in Rails.**\n\n---\n\n## **5. Automating Quartz Updates with GitHub Actions**\n\n### **GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`)**\n```yaml\nname: Sync Quartz Content\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  sync:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Notify Rails Server\n        run: |\n          curl -X POST \"$RAILS_SERVER_URL/api/sync_quartz\" \\\n          -H \"Authorization: Bearer $RAILS_SECRET_KEY\"\n```\n\n### **Rails Sync Endpoint (`app/controllers/api_controller.rb`)**\n```ruby\nclass ApiController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :authenticate_webhook!\n\n  def sync_quartz\n    User.all.each do |user|\n      user.quartz_instance.sync_repo\n      user.quartz_instance.build_quartz_site\n    end\n    render json: { message: \"Quartz content updated\" }\n  end\n\n  private\n  def authenticate_webhook!\n    return if request.headers[\"Authorization\"] == \"Bearer #{ENV['RAILS_SECRET_KEY']}\"\n    render json: { error: \"Unauthorized\" }, status: :unauthorized\n  end\nend\n```\n✅ **Every GitHub push updates and rebuilds the Quartz content in Rails.**\n\n---\n\n## **6. Summary**\n- Users authenticate via Devise.\n- Quartz repos are cloned and updated locally.\n- Each Quartz instance is built into a static site and stored in `storage/quartz/:username/:instance/public`.\n- Quartz assets are symlinked into Rails' `/public/quartz/:username/` to serve efficiently.\n- GitHub Actions triggers Quartz updates automatically.\n\n🚀 **This setup ensures security, scalability, and minimal infrastructure complexity!**"}]}

I've updated the guide to ensure that Quartz instances are built separately as static sites and properly integrated with Rails assets. Let me know if you need additional refinements! 🚀

I dont want a guide. I want a technical implementation and explanation

A **Rails 8 monolith** that handles authentication, paywall logic, and content serving.\n2. Quartz instances, **cloned per user from GitHub**, built as static sites.\n3. Rails serving the Quartz sites securely and managing assets.\n4. GitHub Actions triggering repo syncs automatically.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Setting Up the Rails 8 Application**\n\n### **Initialize the Rails App**\n```sh\nrails new quartz_cms --database=postgresql\ncd quartz_cms\n```\n\n### **Install Required Gems**\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'devise'               # User authentication\ngem 'pg'                   # PostgreSQL database\ngem 'pundit'               # Authorization\ngem 'fileutils'            # File management\ngem 'httparty'             # API calls (optional for syncing)\n```\n```sh\nbundle install\n```\n\n### **User Authentication**\n```sh\nrails generate devise:install\nrails generate devise User\nrails db:migrate\n```\n\n---\n\n## **2. Quartz Instance Management**\n\n### **Database Model for Quartz Instances**\n```ruby\nclass CreateQuartzInstances < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]\n  def change\n    create_table :quartz_instances do |t|\n      t.references :user, null: false, foreign_key: true\n      t.string :repo_url, null: false\n      t.string :local_path\n      t.timestamps\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n```sh\nrails db:migrate\n```\n\n### **QuartzInstance Model**\n```ruby\nrequire 'fileutils'\n\nclass QuartzInstance < ApplicationRecord\n  belongs_to :user\n  after_create :setup_quartz\n\n  def setup_quartz\n    repo_name = repo_url.split(\"/\").last.gsub(\".git\", \"\")\n    base_path = Rails.root.join(\"storage\", \"quartz\", user.username)\n    self.local_path = File.join(base_path, repo_name)\n    \n    unless Dir.exist?(local_path)\n      system(\"git clone #{repo_url} #{local_path}\")\n    end\n    \n    build_quartz_site\n    update(local_path: local_path.to_s)\n  end\n  \n  def sync_repo\n    system(\"cd #{local_path} && git pull origin main\")\n    build_quartz_site\n  end\n  \n  private\n  \n  def build_quartz_site\n    build_path = File.join(local_path, \"public\")\n    FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)\n    system(\"cd #{local_path} && npm install && npm run build\")\n  end\nend\n```\n✅ This ensures each user's Quartz repo is cloned, updated, and built into a static site.\n\n---\n\n## **3.
