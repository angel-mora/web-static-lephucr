Why it could be? I am using dip and did dip up -d and dip infra up and still getting this error



User is using RubyMine for development and has encountered a Redis connection error while running tests in a `Accounts::FeesController` spec. They are using `dip` for their environment setup and have tried `dip up -d` and `dip infra up` commands.

Model set context updated.

The `Redis::ConnectionError` and `ECONNRESET` indicate a lost connection between your application and Redis, despite using `dip` to start the environment. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Redis Container Logs**: Run `docker logs <redis-container-name>` to see if there are any issues, such as the container restarting or errors within Redis itself.

2. **Confirm Redis Availability**: Use `dip run redis-cli ping` or manually connect to Redis using `redis-cli` from the container or local environment. You should see a `PONG` response if Redis is available.

3. **Inspect Network Configurations**: Check that your Rails app is pointing to the correct Redis host and port. If your setup uses `localhost`, try using `redis://redis:6379` or `redis://localhost:6379` depending on your `docker-compose.yml` service names.

4. **Redis Version and Timeout Settings**: Sometimes, a default Redis timeout or memory limit might be restrictive. Check the Redis config file or environment settings in `docker-compose.yml` to see if increasing the `timeout` helps.

5. **Docker Restart**: Occasionally, a restart of Docker can help if the network connection is unstable.

Let me know if any of these steps reveal more details or help resolve the issue!
