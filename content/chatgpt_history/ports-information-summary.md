How to know total packets in pcap file wireshark?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To find out the total number of packets in a pcap file using Wireshark, follow these steps:

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Go to `File > Open` and navigate to your .pcap file. Open it.
3. After the pcap file is loaded, look at the status bar at the bottom of the Wireshark GUI. It should show information like "Loaded [x] of [y] packets".

The "[y]" part is the total number of packets in the pcap file.

Alternatively, you can use the following method:

1. After opening the pcap file in Wireshark, go to `Statistics > Summary`.
2. A new window will open. Under the `Capture File Summary` section, you will find the `Packet Count` field. This is the total number of packets in the pcap file.

Please note that the pcap file needs to be fully loaded before the total packet count is accurately reflected.

What is NS server in wireshark

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

In Wireshark, "NS" typically refers to a DNS Name Server record. The DNS (Domain Name System) is a protocol used on the internet for translating domain names into IP addresses. 

In the context of Wireshark, when you capture network packets, you may see DNS packets which contain different types of resource records, such as:

- A records: These map a domain name to an IPv4 address.
- AAAA records: These map a domain name to an IPv6 address.
- NS records: These identify the name servers responsible for the domain. 

If you see "NS server" in a Wireshark packet capture, it's probably referring to a DNS query or response that includes NS (Name Server) records. This would mean the packet capture includes a request or response for the name servers associated with a particular domain.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I'm looking for a phone number in wireshark, where could I find it? DNS data?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Finding a phone number in Wireshark can be quite challenging because phone numbers are not usually transmitted in clear text over a network. In general, they will be part of the application data, often sent using protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS, and they will usually be encrypted if the data transmission is secure (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

However, if the phone number is being transmitted in plain text over an unencrypted protocol, and if you have a packet capture while this transmission was occurring, you might be able to find it. Here's how you could approach it:

1. Open your packet capture file in Wireshark.
2. Use the "Filter" bar to search through the packets. You could try filtering by HTTP if you suspect the phone number was transmitted over HTTP.

If you don't know the protocol, you could also try a simple "string" or "hex value" search across all packets:

1. Go to `Edit > Find Packet...`
2. In the Find Packet dialog, you can search by "String" or "Hex value", and make sure to select "Packet bytes" in the "Search In" dropdown.
3. Enter part or all of the phone number as your search string, and then click "Find".

Please note that this will only work if the phone number was transmitted in plain text over an unencrypted protocol, and if you have a packet capture of the transmission.

And remember, it's important to have legal and ethical permission to examine any network traffic. The privacy of communication should always be respected.

From the questions above, provide answers whenever you can and a way to calculate it with ruby code whenever you can

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

1. Binary signals have two states: `0` and `1`.

2. Convert to ASCII: "01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100" translates to "secret". You can use the following Ruby code:
    ```ruby
    "01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100".split.map {|c| c.to_i(2).chr}.join
    ```

3. Hex of ESC: The hexadecimal equivalent of the ESC (Escape) character in ASCII is `1B`.

4. Convert from Hex to ASCII: "68 69" translates to "Hi". You can use the following Ruby code:
    ```ruby
    "68 69".split.map {|c| c.to_i(16).chr}.join
    ```

5. IP address of "11000000.00101010.00111000.00100000" is `192.42.56.32`. You can use the following Ruby code:
    ```ruby
    "11000000.00101010.00111000.00100000".split('.').map{|i| i.to_i(2)}.join('.')
    ```

6. The provided binary string for the IP address seems incorrect, it's too long to represent a valid IP address.

7. 3 Digit ASN number of the above IP: This would require a lookup in an IP to ASN database which isn't possible in a local Ruby script without an API or database.

8. Total host IPs in "192.243.3.0/18": In a /18 subnet, there are 2^(32-18) - 2 host addresses, which equals 16382 addresses. Ruby calculation:
    ```ruby
    2**(32-18) - 2 # 16382
    ```

9. "00:0a:95:9d:68:16" is an example of a MAC address.

10. Vendor name of that MAC address: The vendor can be identified by the first three octets of the MAC address (also known as the Organizationally Unique Identifier, or OUI). In this case, "00:0a:95" points to "Apple Inc.". This would typically require a lookup in a MAC to vendor database, but the specific OUI "00:0a:95" is known to be registered to Apple. Ruby code to extract the OUI:
    ```ruby
    mac = "00:0a:95:9d:68:16"
    oui = mac.split(':').take(3).join(':') # "00:0a:95"
    ```

each one of these binaries to decimals and join them with dot. Return just the ip

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The provided binary strings are too long to represent a standard 8-bit segment of an IP address. Each segment of an IP address in binary form should have 8 bits, but each string provided has 54 bits.

However, assuming that each binary string was meant to be 32 bits (since a full IP address is 32 bits in length), then the strings have to be segmented properly before they can be converted into decimal form to form an IP address.

Please check the binary data and provide corrected 32-bit binary IP addresses for conversion to decimal.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

100111000101000111001110101010001001000001001101010110.100111000101001000100010011001001100011110111110011010.100111000111100111001000111110001011011101001001111000.100111000101000111001110100100110010000100101100100000
So how can you decode this to find an ip address?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The binary string you've provided is too long for a typical IP address. Normally, an IP address consists of four octets (four segments of 8 bits each, for a total of 32 bits). Each of these 8-bit segments can be converted from binary to decimal to form the four parts of an IPv4 address.

However, each segment in the provided string is much longer than 8 bits. If these are intended to represent IPv6 addresses, they are still too long, as IPv6 addresses are typically represented with 16-bit segments.

Given the structure of your binary string, it's not possible to convert this directly into an IP address using standard IP addressing schemes (IPv4 or IPv6).

Could you please provide additional context or check the binary data? A standard IPv4 binary string should look something like this: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00001011` which translates to `192.168.1.11` in decimal format.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I translated them from binary to decimal and got this:
156 81 206 168 144 77 22 56 164 68 201 143 124 26 113 231 35 226 221 39 8 226 142 116 153 9 100 0, is there anything you can infer from it?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The string you've provided contains 24 decimal numbers. While it's too many to form a standard IP address (which requires 4 numbers for IPv4 or 16 numbers for IPv6), it could possibly represent multiple IP addresses or a mixture of information, potentially including port numbers or other data. 

If we were to assume these are IPv4 addresses, the string could represent six different addresses, like so:

1. 156.81.206.168
2. 144.77.22.56
3. 164.68.201.143
4. 124.26.113.231
5. 35.226.221.39
6. 8.226.142.116

The last two numbers, 153 and 9, do not fit into this pattern and could potentially be port numbers or part of some other information.

Without further context, it's difficult to infer exactly what these numbers represent. If this data was derived from a specific application, device, or service, further details about that source could help to interpret this data.
