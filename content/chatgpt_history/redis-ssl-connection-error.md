Got this error from the docker container when trying to run my spec




The error youâ€™re encounteringâ€”`SSL routines::wrong version number`â€”indicates that the Redis client is trying to use SSL, but the Redis server in your Docker container is not configured to support SSL connections.

Hereâ€™s how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Check Redis Connection URL**
If your Redis client is configured to use SSL, ensure that the connection URL or configuration doesnâ€™t mistakenly include `rediss://` (which implies SSL). Instead, it should be:

```yaml
REDIS_URL: redis://<hostname>:6379
```

---

### **2. Verify Client Configuration**
If you are using a Ruby Redis client, check the client initialization:

```ruby
Redis.new(url: "redis://localhost:6379")
```

Ensure that no SSL-related options like `ssl: true` are set unless your Redis server explicitly supports SSL.

---

### **3. Check if Your Client Requires SSL**
Some cloud-hosted Redis services require SSL, and the client might be preconfigured for it. If thatâ€™s the case, but your local Docker Redis instance doesnâ€™t support SSL, you might be able to disable SSL in the client config for local development, like:

```ruby
Redis.new(url: "redis://localhost:6379", ssl: false)
```

---

### **4. Ensure Redis Container is Running Without SSL**
By default, the official Redis Docker image doesnâ€™t enable SSL. To confirm, inspect your Redis container logs:

```bash
docker logs <redis-container-id>
```

You should see a line like:

```plaintext
* Ready to accept connections
```

If SSL were enabled, it would mention an SSL listener.

---

### **5. Fix Docker Network Configuration**
The error also mentions `addr=192.168.65.1` and `laddr=172.18.0.3`. This suggests that Redis might be accessed via an external IP. Ensure that:

- Your app is correctly communicating with the Redis container via the internal Docker network (`redis://redis:6379`).
- Your `docker-compose.yml` has a properly configured network:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    depends_on:
      - redis
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379
    networks:
      - app_network

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
```

---

### **6. Test Redis Connection with `redis-cli`**
You can use `redis-cli` inside the Redis container to test if Redis is running correctly:

```bash
docker exec -it <redis-container-id> redis-cli
ping
```

You should get:

```plaintext
PONG
```

Would you like me to generate a quick Redis and Rails setup guide using Docker that ensures proper connection for your specs?

127.0.0.1:6379> ping
Error: Connection reset by peer


The error `Connection reset by peer` typically means that the Redis server is either not running, has crashed, or is refusing the connection for some reason. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Check Redis Container Status**
Ensure that the Redis container is up and running:

```bash
docker ps
```

If the container is not listed, it might have stopped. You can check the logs to see why it stopped:

```bash
docker logs <redis-container-id>
```

Look for any errors or indications of why Redis might have crashed.

---

### **2. Restart the Redis Container**
Try restarting the container to see if the issue is temporary:

```bash
docker restart <redis-container-id>
```

Then, test the connection again using `redis-cli`:

```bash
docker exec -it <redis-container-id> redis-cli
ping
```

---

### **3. Check for Port Binding Issues**
Ensure that Redis is correctly bound to the expected IP address and port. In your Redis configuration (`redis.conf`), look for the following line:

```plaintext
bind 127.0.0.1
```

If Redis is bound only to `127.0.0.1` but you are trying to access it from another container, it will refuse the connection. To allow connections from other Docker containers, you can modify the bind address to:

```plaintext
bind 0.0.0.0
```

Or comment it out entirely to bind to all network interfaces:

```plaintext
# bind 127.0.0.1
```

After making changes, restart the container.

---

### **4. Check for Firewalls or Network Policies**
If you're running on a host machine with strict network policies, ensure that nothing is blocking the Redis port (6379). If youâ€™re using Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows, sometimes the internal Docker network can behave unexpectedly, so restarting Docker itself may help.

---

### **5. Run Redis Without Config File**
If the problem persists, try running Redis without a configuration file to rule out config issues:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

Then test the connection using:

```bash
redis-cli
ping
```

---

### **6. Rebuild the Docker Environment**
If nothing else works, consider rebuilding your entire Docker environment:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
docker-compose up --build
```

---

Would you like help diagnosing the logs from your Redis container? You can share the output, and Iâ€™ll help analyze it.

I am using dip
redis rubymine net time out rspec

It looks like you are using `dip` to manage your Docker-based development environment, and youâ€™re encountering a timeout when trying to connect to Redis from RubyMine during your RSpec tests.

### **Steps to troubleshoot and resolve Redis timeout in `dip` environment**

---

### **1. Check if Redis is Running with Dip**
Ensure that Redis is running as part of the `dip` environment:

```bash
dip ps
```

You should see something like:

```plaintext
     Name                    Command               State             Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
myapp_redis_1   docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...    Up      6379/tcp
```

If Redis is not listed or not in the `Up` state, try bringing up the services:

```bash
dip up redis
```

---

### **2. Test Redis Connection from Inside the App Container**
To check if the application can reach Redis, open a shell in the application container and use `redis-cli` to ping Redis:

```bash
dip bash
apt-get update && apt-get install redis-tools -y  # Install redis-cli if not available
redis-cli -h redis ping
```

If Redis responds with `PONG`, the connection is working.

---

### **3. Ensure the Correct Redis URL in the Rails App**
Your Rails app should be configured to connect to Redis using the correct hostname, which is typically the service name (`redis`) in Docker Compose or `dip.yml`.

In your `config/redis.yml` or wherever you configure Redis in the Rails app, ensure it looks like this:

```yaml
development:
  url: redis://redis:6379
test:
  url: redis://redis:6379
```

---

### **4. Check Network Configuration in `dip.yml`**
Ensure that both your app and Redis services are part of the same network in `dip.yml` or `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    networks:
      - app_network
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
```

If they are not on the same network, they wonâ€™t be able to communicate.

---

### **5. Increase Timeout in RSpec Configuration**
Sometimes the connection timeout occurs because Redis takes a little longer to start or respond. You can increase the timeout in your RSpec configuration:

In `spec_helper.rb` or `rails_helper.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    Redis.new(url: "redis://redis:6379", timeout: 5) # Increase timeout to 5 seconds
  end
end
```

---

### **6. Check for Docker Desktop Networking Issues (macOS/Windows)**
If youâ€™re using Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows, networking issues can sometimes arise. Restarting Docker Desktop can help resolve these temporary issues.

---

### **7. Check Redis Logs**
If Redis is up but still timing out, inspect the Redis logs for any errors:

```bash
dip logs redis
```

Look for any indications of connection issues or crashes.

Would you like me to generate a sample `dip.yml` file with proper Redis and Rails configurations for your setup?
