ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The Rails Guides website is part of the Ruby on Rails source code repository. You can clone this repository to get access to the Rails Guides and run them locally on your machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. Ensure you have Git installed on your computer. If you do not have Git, you can download and install it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to clone the Ruby on Rails repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rails/rails.git
```

4. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `guides` directory within the `rails` directory:

```bash
cd rails/guides
```

5. The Rails Guides use Ruby on Rails itself to generate the guides. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You might also need the 'bundler' gem to manage dependencies. Install it if you haven't yet:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

6. Install the dependencies for the guides:

```bash
bundle install
```

7. To generate and view the guides locally, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake guides:generate
```

8. The generated guides will be in the `rails/guides/output` directory. You can open them in your web browser by navigating to this directory and opening the `index.html` file, or you can use any web server to serve the `output` directory.

For example, if you have Python installed, you can start a simple HTTP server with the following command (the command might vary depending on your Python version):

- For Python 3.x:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

- For Python 2.x:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the guides.

Remember, these steps are based on the current structure and requirements of the Ruby on Rails repository as of my last update. It's always a good idea to check the README file in the `rails/guides` directory for any updated instructions or additional requirements.
