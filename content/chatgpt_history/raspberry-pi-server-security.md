Is there any advantage in using omv instead of raspberry os for my raspberry? Security is my main concern and I want to end up using the device as my personal server

OpenMediaVault (OMV) and Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) are both valid operating systems for your Raspberry Pi, but they have slightly different focuses which may affect your choice, especially if you're interested in setting up a personal server.

Raspberry Pi OS is a general-purpose operating system based on Debian. It is designed to be user-friendly and suitable for beginners, while still offering the flexibility and power of a full Linux distribution. It comes with a large number of pre-installed applications and has a broad community support base. However, it is not specifically designed for server use.

OpenMediaVault (OMV), on the other hand, is a Debian-based operating system designed specifically for network-attached storage (NAS). It provides a web-based interface for managing your storage, sharing files over the network, and installing plugins for additional functionality such as media servers, BitTorrent clients, and backup services. This makes it a good choice if you want to use your Raspberry Pi as a personal server.

In terms of security, both Raspberry Pi OS and OMV have their strengths. As both are based on Debian, they have access to the vast array of security updates and packages available to Debian users. OMV, however, might have a slight advantage for server use specifically, due to its specialized nature. It's specifically designed for network-attached storage and server use, so its default configuration and available plugins may be more focused on securing your server against common threats.

However, the security of any system ultimately depends on how well it's maintained. This includes regularly updating your software to patch any security vulnerabilities, using strong, unique passwords, setting up a firewall, and considering other security best practices such as using two-factor authentication or VPNs where appropriate.

Remember that both operating systems are highly flexible and can be customized to suit your needs. You could start with Raspberry Pi OS and then install server software as needed, or start with OMV and add any additional software you require.

Ultimately, your choice might depend more on which operating system you're more comfortable with and which one better suits your specific use case. Both are capable choices for setting up a personal server on a Raspberry Pi.

And if I want to have my server available out of my home?

If you want to make your server accessible from outside your home network, there are several steps you need to take:

1. **Port Forwarding:** You need to set up port forwarding on your router. This allows incoming connections on specific ports to be forwarded directly to your Raspberry Pi. The exact process for this will depend on your router's make and model.

2. **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** Most residential internet connections use a dynamic IP address that changes periodically. DDNS services can give you a stable domain name that updates automatically when your IP address changes.

3. **Firewall:** It's important to have a firewall in place when exposing a server to the internet. This can be configured on the Raspberry Pi itself, and you should also ensure that your router has a built-in firewall enabled.

4. **Secure Connection:** When you're accessing your server from outside your home, it's important to ensure that the connection is secure. Using protocols like SSH for accessing your server, or HTTPS for web services, can help to encrypt your connection and protect your data. Consider setting up a VPN for a secure, encrypted tunnel to access your home network.

5. **Regular updates:** Keeping your Raspberry Pi's operating system and software up to date is crucial when exposing it to the internet. Regular updates will ensure that you have the latest security patches.

6. **Monitoring:** Regularly check your server logs for any suspicious activity. There are various tools available that can assist with this, including fail2ban, a utility that can help protect your server from brute-force attacks.

Both Raspberry Pi OS and OpenMediaVault can be configured for remote access, and the security principles are the same for each. OpenMediaVault may have some advantages due to its server-focused design, such as built-in support for secure protocols and easy setup of shared directories.

However, regardless of which OS you choose, exposing a server to the internet always comes with risks. Make sure to follow best practices for server security, and consider seeking advice from a professional if you're unsure.

Tell me all the security measures I need to take for my raspberry to be a public server so I can access it remotely.

There are several important measures you should consider to secure your Raspberry Pi, particularly if you're planning to make it a public server. Here's a detailed list:

1. **Change the Default Password:** The Raspberry Pi comes with a default username ("pi") and password ("raspberry"). The first step in securing your Pi is to change this default password to something strong and unique.

2. **Update Your System:** Regularly updating your Raspberry Pi's operating system and installed software is crucial. This ensures you have the latest security patches and reduces the risk of exploitation. Use the `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` commands regularly.

3. **Use a Firewall:** A firewall restricts incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a good option for beginners. You can specify which ports should be open or closed to control the traffic to your server.

4. **Fail2ban:** Install and configure Fail2ban. Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention software that protects your Raspberry Pi from brute-force attacks by blocking the IP addresses that show malicious signs, like too many password failures.

5. **Secure Shell (SSH):** If you need to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, use SSH, which is a secure method of accessing command line prompts of devices. Avoid using default port 22 for SSH to minimize the risk from automated attacks. Use key-based authentication rather than password-based authentication, and disable root login over SSH.

6. **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Any service or process running on your Raspberry Pi is a potential point of entry for attackers. Disable any services or processes that you don't need.

7. **Port Forwarding:** When you're setting up port forwarding on your router, only forward the ports that are necessary for your server to function. Each forwarded port is a potential entry point for an attacker.

8. **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** If you're accessing your server from outside your network, you'll likely need a DDNS service to handle your changing public IP. However, be sure that the connection is secure - log in to the DDNS service using HTTPS, not HTTP.

9. **Use HTTPS:** If you're hosting a web server, use HTTPS instead of HTTP. This encrypts the connection between your server and your users, protecting the data being transmitted.

10. **Use a VPN:** If possible, consider setting up a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This allows you to access your home network as if you were home, even when you're not. It provides a secure, encrypted tunnel to protect your data.

11. **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly check your server logs for any suspicious activity. This can help you identify and respond to attacks.

12. **Backup Regularly:** Regular backups are a crucial part of maintaining any server. They ensure that you can quickly recover in case something goes wrong.

Remember, even with these precautions, no server is 100% secure. These measures will significantly reduce your risk, but they cannot eliminate it entirely. Always stay vigilant and keep yourself updated with the latest in security best practices.

Consult me about the nature of my public port to access my raspberry remotely. Ask information to use it for firewalld/ufw, ssh, vpn as well as port forwarding config in my router. You will use this information to provide me a tutorial to configure my raspberry server connection after I respond.

Sure, I can provide a step-by-step tutorial for you. However, I'll need some additional information. Please provide the following details:

1. The SSH port you intend to use: The default is 22, but it's often recommended to change this to a non-standard, high number for additional security.
   
2. The VPN protocol you intend to use: Different VPN protocols require different ports to be open. For example, OpenVPN uses port 1194 by default.

3. The type of server you intend to host (if any), and the port it uses: For example, a web server typically uses ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.

4. Information about your router: The exact process for setting up port forwarding varies depending on the make and model of your router. If you provide this information, I can give more specific instructions.

5. Whether you've already installed and set up firewalld or ufw on your Raspberry Pi, or whether you need instructions on how to do this.

Once I have this information, I'll be able to provide a more detailed tutorial.

My criteria is free, open source, least priviledge, sudo access (except destroy) and willing to use whichever port and config that make my connection more secure. I only want to have https enabled, no http connection whatsoever. I haven't set the raspberry but am well documented about ufw/firewalld so I'll be able to follow along your tutorial.
My router port forwarding section asks for:
name, protocol (tcp, udp or both), wan connection (auto or one other param), wan host ip address, lan host, wan port (INPUT FIELD ~ INPUT FIELD) and lan port (INPUT FIELD ~ INPUT FIELD)
I want you to give me an advice if I wanted to only connect over ssh. I might ask about exposing a port for a rails app too later but not now.
Remember I am using OMV in my raspberry and want to have as many disabled unused services as possible.

Great, based on your specifications and using OpenMediaVault (OMV) on your Raspberry Pi, here is a general guideline on how to set things up securely. 

**Step 1 - Setup SSH on a Non-Standard Port**

Start by changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard, high port number. This makes it harder for attackers to guess which port SSH is running on. For example, we'll use port 52200, but you can choose any unused port number above 1024.

Edit the SSHD configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line that says `#Port 22`, remove the `#`, and change `22` to `52200`:

```bash
Port 52200
```

Then, save and exit the nano editor by pressing `Ctrl+X`, followed by `Y`, then `Enter`.

Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

**Step 2 - Configure UFW**

Install UFW using the command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ufw
```

Now, let's setup UFW:

First, deny all incoming traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

Then, allow all outgoing traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

Now, open up the SSH port (the one you set up in step 1):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 52200/tcp
```

Enable UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Check UFW status:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

The SSH port should be listed as allowed, and the defaults should be denying incoming, allowing outgoing.

**Step 3 - Router Configuration**

Now, you'll need to setup port forwarding on your router. Although the exact steps will vary depending on the model of your router, the general steps are:

- Name: You can use any name, for example "SSH"
- Protocol: Set to TCP
- WAN connection: Set to "Auto" unless you have a specific WAN connection to use
- WAN host IP address: You can usually leave this blank, unless you want to restrict access to a specific external IP address
- LAN host: This should be the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on your local network
- WAN port and LAN port: Set both to the SSH port you chose earlier (52200 in our example)

After you apply these settings, connections to your public IP address on the SSH port should be forwarded to your Raspberry Pi.

**Step 4 - HTTPS only**

For serving a web application over HTTPS only, you'll need to install an SSL certificate on your server and configure the application to use it. 

You would usually use port 443 for HTTPS. This will require you to open the port on your UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

Then, on your router, you would need to add a new port forwarding rule with the same settings as above, but with the WAN port and LAN port set to 443.

Keep in mind, you mentioned you don't want to serve the Rails app just yet, so you can do this later when you're ready to deploy the application.

Remember, the principle of least privilege dictates that ports and services should only be opened when necessary, and closed when not in use. So only do these steps when you're ready to deploy your Rails app.

I hope this helps you get started with securing your Raspberry Pi server. Let me know if you have any further questions!

Question 1: Is the raspberry pi port in my router permanent or I need to do something to make it static?

The LAN host setting in your router's port forwarding configuration should be set to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on your local network. Most home networks use something called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which assigns IP addresses to devices dynamically as they join the network. This means that the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi might change if it disconnects and reconnects to the network.

If your router supports it, one way to ensure your Raspberry Pi always has the same local IP address is to set up a DHCP reservation. This tells the router to always assign the same IP address to the Raspberry Pi. The exact steps to do this depend on your router's make and model, but generally you'll need to go into the DHCP or LAN settings in your router's administration interface and look for a setting called "DHCP Reservation", "Static Leases" or similar. You'll need the MAC address of your Raspberry Pi's network interface, which you can find by running `ip addr` on the Pi.

Another way to ensure a static IP address is to manually configure a static IP on the Raspberry Pi itself. However, if you choose this method, you need to be careful to choose an IP address that's outside the range of addresses your router's DHCP server assigns, but still within the same subnet. Here is a general way to do this on Raspberry Pi OS:

Edit the dhcpcd configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following lines:

```bash
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.XX/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
```

In this example, replace `192.168.1.XX` with the desired static IP address, and replace `192.168.1.1` with the IP address of your router. You might need to adjust these based on your network setup. After making these changes, save and exit the file (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`), and restart the dhcpcd service:

```bash
sudo service dhcpcd restart
```

Remember, if you decide to set a static IP, it is crucial to assign an address that doesn't conflict with any other device on your network, and it should be outside the DHCP range of the router to prevent IP conflicts. You can usually find this range in your router's DHCP settings. 

Generally, it's easier and safer to set up a DHCP reservation in your router, if possible, since this avoids potential IP conflicts and doesn't require messing with your Pi's network settings.

I want to share with you my services and its statuses, tell me the most optimal way to compact the output of systemctl -t service -all, like removing the service word, replacing LOAD, ACTIVE and SUB so I the output fits within my next prompt

If you'd like to create a more compact output for the `systemctl -t service --all` command, you can use `awk`, a versatile tool that allows you to manipulate and format text. Here's a simple way to remove "service" from the output, as well as shorten the headers for load, active, and sub:

```bash
systemctl -t service --all | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}' | sed 's/.service//g' | sed '1s/LOAD/LD/' | sed '1s/ACTIVE/AC/' | sed '1s/SUB/SB/'
```

This command does the following:

- `awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}'` limits the output to the first four columns: UNIT, LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB.
- `sed 's/.service//g'` removes the ".service" suffix from the UNIT names.
- The last three `sed` commands replace the headers for LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB with shortened versions (LD, AC, SB).

This will give you a more compact output, but please note that this command simplifies the output a lot, so it might leave out important details. If you encounter a service with issues, you may want to use the full `systemctl status` command for that service to get complete information.

Also remove the breaklines of the output

To remove breaklines and output all the data on one line, you can use the `tr` command to replace newline characters (`\n`) with another character, such as a space:

```bash
systemctl -t service --all | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}' | sed 's/.service//g' | sed '1s/LOAD/LD/' | sed '1s/ACTIVE/AC/' | sed '1s/SUB/SB/' | tr '\n' ' '
```

This command will output all the data on a single line, with each service's status separated by a space. Note that this will make the output quite hard to read if you have a lot of services. You might want to pipe the output to a file or a less/more command to view it more easily:

```bash
systemctl -t service --all | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}' | sed 's/.service//g' | sed '1s/LOAD/LD/' | sed '1s/ACTIVE/AC/' | sed '1s/SUB/SB/' | tr '\n' ' ' > services_status.txt
```

This will save the output to a text file named `services_status.txt`, which you can view with any text editor or with commands like `less` or `more`.

What do you think about these services before making my pi public?

Reviewing the status of services is crucial before exposing your Raspberry Pi to the public internet. Services should only be running if they're required; any unnecessary services should be disabled to reduce potential security vulnerabilities.

Based on the output you provided, here are some points to consider:

1. Fail2Ban: It appears that Fail2Ban has failed to load. Fail2Ban is an important security tool that protects your system from brute-force attacks. Ensure that it is installed and configured correctly.

2. Services Not Found: Several services are listed as "not-found." Some of these may not be required for your use case (such as `connman`, `iscsi`, `firewalld`, `ip6tables`, `iptables`, `NetworkManager`, `ntp`, `ovsdb-server`, `php7.0-fpm`, `plymouth-start`, etc.), but you should investigate why others might be missing. In many cases, these are services that aren't installed on your system or are specific to other Linux distributions, so their absence is not concerning.

3. Open Services: Ensure that only necessary services are open and exposed. For example, if you're not using Bluetooth (`bluetooth`), it's safer to disable it. Similarly, if you're not using Avahi for local network discovery (`avahi-daemon`), consider disabling it as well. 

4. Disabled Services: You have some services that are inactive or disabled (`dhcpd`, `nfs-server`, `rpcbind`, `systemd-networkd-wait-online`, etc.). Ensure that these are intentionally disabled and not needed for your setup. 

5. Web Server: Your output shows that the `nginx` service is active. If you plan on serving web content, ensure that it's correctly configured and secure.

6. VPN: You have a service for NordVPN (`nordvpnd`). Ensure it's correctly set up if you plan on using a VPN for remote access.

7. SMB: Your `smbd` service is active, which is used for sharing files over a network. Ensure it is secure if you plan on using it.

8. Services in Error State: `ifup@wlan0` and `wpa_supplicant@wlan0` appear to be in a failed state. If you're planning to connect your Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi, these services need to be running correctly. If you're using a wired connection, it's less of a concern.

9. SSH: Your `ssh` service is active. Ensure you're following best practices for securing SSH, including using key-based authentication, disabling root login, and changing the default port.

These are just a few key points based on your current setup. Security is a broad and complex field, and this is not an exhaustive list. It's always good to follow a defense-in-depth strategy and take multiple precautions to protect your system. Additionally, it's recommended to keep your system and all software up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Always stay informed about new vulnerabilities and security practices.


How about the security onion setup for a remote IDS?

Security Onion is a free and open-source Linux distribution used for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management. It can be a good choice for your use case, especially if you're interested in learning about network security and intrusion detection.

Setting up Security Onion as a remote Intrusion Detection System (IDS) would add another layer to your security, especially when your Raspberry Pi is exposed to the internet. Here are the general steps for setting up Security Onion:

1. **Download and Install Security Onion:** You can download the latest Security Onion image from their official website. However, please note that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Security Onion does not support Raspberry Pi directly because it's based on a 64-bit architecture. You might need a different device to run Security Onion or consider other IDS solutions that support Raspberry Pi, such as Snort or Suricata.

2. **Configure Security Onion:** After installation, you will need to configure Security Onion based on your requirements. The Setup wizard will guide you through the configuration process.

3. **Network Configuration:** You need to monitor the traffic that's coming in and out of your Raspberry Pi. Typically, in an enterprise setting, the IDS would be connected to a TAP or SPAN port on a network switch to monitor network traffic. For a home network, you might need a managed switch with port mirroring capability or use your router, if it supports such functionality, to duplicate traffic to the port where your IDS is listening.

4. **Review Alerts:** After the system is set up and it's receiving network traffic, it will start to generate alerts based on the rules set in the IDS. These alerts can be viewed in the Security Onion console.

5. **Tune Your IDS:** Over time, you will want to tune your IDS to reduce false positives and better cater to your environment.

Please note, using an IDS is part of a larger security strategy and it requires regular maintenance and review. Also, an IDS won't actively block threats - instead, it's a monitoring system designed to alert you to potential issues.

Again, remember that Security Onion may not run directly on Raspberry Pi. There are other IDS solutions like Suricata and Zeek (formerly known as Bro) that you might want to explore that can run directly on a Raspberry Pi.

So how can I securitize my raspberry? OMV antivirus? Are there IDS and IRS solutions I can implement in Raspberry? If so, provide a tutorial to do so as part of my publication of the server

Securing your Raspberry Pi server involves multiple aspects, ranging from the basics like keeping the system updated, setting strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services, to more advanced configurations like setting up firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

1. **Keeping the System Updated:** Always keep your system and all software up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Use the commands `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` to keep your system updated.

2. **Strong Passwords:** Always set strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. 

3. **Limit User Privileges:** Make sure to follow the principle of least privilege: users should only have the privileges they need to perform their tasks, and no more.

4. **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Review the services running on your system (with `systemctl -t service --state=running`), and disable any services that are not necessary for your server's intended functionality.

5. **Install a Firewall:** You mentioned earlier that you are familiar with UFW and firewalld. These can help manage what connections are allowed to and from your server. 

6. **SSH Hardening:** Use SSH keys instead of passwords, disable root login, and change the default port for SSH.

Now, in terms of antivirus, there are a few options you can consider:

- **ClamAV:** This is a free and open-source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware, and other malicious threats. To install it, you can use `sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon`. You can then run a scan with `clamscan -r /` to scan your entire system.

As for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), you can use Suricata. Here's a simple setup guide:

1. **Install Suricata:** You can install Suricata with `sudo apt install suricata`.

2. **Configure Suricata:** The main configuration file for Suricata is located at `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`. Make sure to configure the network you want Suricata to monitor, and other parameters as per your requirements.

3. **Update Suricata Rules:** Rules tell Suricata what to look for in the traffic it monitors. You can use the Emerging Threats Open ruleset, which is free. To update your rules, you can use `sudo suricata-update`.

4. **Start Suricata:** Now you can start Suricata with `sudo service suricata start`.

Remember, Suricata (and IDS/IPS in general) requires careful tuning to minimize false positives. Regular monitoring and maintenance are also necessary.

Finally, consider setting up automatic security updates. You can install the unattended-upgrades package with `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`, and configure it to automatically install security updates.

These are just a few steps towards hardening your Raspberry Pi server. The exact steps you should take depend on the specific needs and threat model of your server. Always stay informed about new vulnerabilities and security practices to keep your system secure.

Huawei router asks me to input an external source ip address, what should I put there?

In the context of port forwarding, the "External Source IP Address" field in your router settings is likely asking for the IP address of the device or network that should be allowed to initiate connections to your forwarded port.

If you want your Raspberry Pi server to be accessible from any device on the internet (assuming they know your public IP and forwarded port number), you should enter a wildcard entry here, which is typically "0.0.0.0" or sometimes "*". This tells the router that any IP address can connect.

If you want to restrict access to a specific IP or set of IPs, you would enter that/those IP(s) here. This would make your Raspberry Pi server accessible only from those specific IPs.

But be careful! Port forwarding exposes your Raspberry Pi to the public internet, making it potentially reachable by malicious actors. If you're opening a port for SSH, make sure to secure SSH access by using key-based authentication, disabling root login, and potentially changing the default SSH port from 22 to another port.

Remember that your security should be layered. In addition to setting up firewall rules and secure SSH, also consider setting up an intrusion detection system and regularly updating and patching your software.

Lastly, be aware that the External Source IP Address can usually be dynamic as most home internet service providers periodically change your public IP address. If you are restricting access to a specific IP, make sure to update this setting if your IP changes. Consider using a dynamic DNS service if your public IP address changes frequently.

I have my rule set, now how can I know my raspberry public ip?

Your Raspberry Pi does not have a public IP address itself. Instead, it is assigned a private IP address on your home network, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns a public IP address to your router. When you set up port forwarding, you're telling your router to route traffic it receives at a particular port on its public IP address to a specific port on the private IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

To find the public IP address of your router, you can use various online services from any device connected to your home network. These services will display the public IP address of the router to which the device is connected. Here are a few options:

1. Open a web browser and go to https://www.google.com/, then type "What is my IP" in the search bar, and Google will display your public IP address.

2. Visit a website like https://www.whatismyip.com/ or https://www.ipchicken.com/. These sites will display your public IP address upon visiting.

Remember, this is the public IP address of your router, not your Raspberry Pi. If you've set up port forwarding correctly, external devices will be able to use this public IP address (and the correct port number) to reach your Raspberry Pi.

Also, note that many ISPs regularly change your public IP address, a practice known as "dynamic IP." If you need to regularly access your Raspberry Pi over the internet, consider using a Dynamic DNS service to assign a domain name to your changing IP address.

bash command to know my ip

If you're looking for a way to get your public IP address from the command line, you can use a tool like `curl` to access one of the web services that returns your public IP address. Here's a command that you can use:

```bash
curl -s ifconfig.me
```

This command will return your public IP address. `-s` is used to run `curl` in silent mode so it doesn't display progress meter or error messages.

Remember, this returns the public IP address of your router to which your Raspberry Pi is connected, not the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi itself.

I did it, got an ip address and used it to connect with my user@ip at specific port and it's not responding. Tell me how to troubleshoot it from bash

If you're unable to connect to your Raspberry Pi server via SSH using your public IP address and port number, there could be several possible reasons. Here's how you can troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check Your SSH Service**: Ensure that the SSH service is running on your Raspberry Pi. You can check this with the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

This command will show the status of the SSH service. If it's not running, you can start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

2. **Check Port Forwarding Settings**: Verify your port forwarding settings on your router. Make sure you've forwarded the correct external port to the correct internal port on your Raspberry Pi's IP address.

3. **Check Firewall Settings**: Ensure that your firewall (on the Raspberry Pi, the router, or both) isn't blocking the connection. If you're using ufw on your Raspberry Pi, you can check the status with:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

This should show you if traffic on your SSH port is allowed. If it's not, you can allow it with:

```bash
sudo ufw allow [your-ssh-port]
```

4. **Check Network Connection**: Make sure your Raspberry Pi has a stable network connection. You can test this by pinging a public server, for example:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

5. **Check Public IP Address**: Verify that the public IP address you're using is correct. If your ISP changes your public IP address dynamically, it might have changed.

6. **Try Local Connection**: Try connecting to the SSH server locally first (from the same local network), using the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi. If this works, the problem is likely related to your port forwarding settings or your public IP address. If this doesn't work, the problem is likely with your SSH server setup.

Remember, always be careful when opening up services to the public internet. Make sure all your services are secured and patched regularly.

I think it's port forwarding. I have the intervnal host with the ip and device name in my Huawei router but the external source ip address I lef those couple of inputs empty

If you believe the issue lies with port forwarding, then it would be beneficial to double-check your port forwarding settings in your Huawei router. Here are some general steps for setting up port forwarding:

1. Log into your Huawei router's web interface. This is typically accessible via a web browser using the router's local IP address, which is often something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

2. Find the port forwarding settings. This is often located under a section like "Advanced," "Security," or "NAT."

3. Set up a new port forwarding rule or verify the existing rule. You'll need to specify:

    - The external port (or range of ports) that you want to forward. This is the port number you'll use to access your Raspberry Pi from the internet.

    - The internal IP address of your Raspberry Pi. This is the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi on your home network.

    - The internal port (or range of ports) on your Raspberry Pi that you want to forward traffic to. For SSH, this is typically port 22 (unless you've changed it).

    - The protocol for the rule. For SSH, this will be TCP.

The "external source IP address" field in some routers allows you to restrict which external IP addresses can use the port forwarding rule. This can be useful for security, as it means only traffic from those IP addresses will be forwarded. However, if you're trying to access your Raspberry Pi from various locations on the internet, you'll need to leave these fields empty or set to a value that represents "any" or "all" IP addresses (the specific value may vary depending on your router's interface).

Save your port forwarding rule and then try again to access your Raspberry Pi via SSH using your public IP address and the external port number. Remember to replace the IP address and port in the SSH command like this: `ssh your-user-name@your-public-ip -p your-external-port`.

If you're still having trouble, consult your router's manual or online help resources. The exact steps can vary depending on the specific model of your Huawei router.

I think my external IP port is wrong and don't know what to put in there

The external port is the port that you'll be connecting to from the internet. When setting up port forwarding, you have the option to use the same port number as the internal port (the port that the service on your Raspberry Pi is listening on), or you can choose a different one.

For example, if you're setting up SSH (which by default listens on port 22), you could choose to use port 22 as your external port as well. In this case, when you connect from the internet, you'd use your public IP address and port 22.

However, for additional security, it's often recommended to use a non-standard external port. This can help to reduce the number of automated attacks that are typically directed at common ports like 22. You could choose a port number like 2222 or 8022, or any other unused port number between 1024 and 49151.

Here's what the rule might look like:

- External Port: 2222
- Internal IP: [your Raspberry Pi's local IP address]
- Internal Port: 22
- Protocol: TCP

Then, when you connect via SSH, you would use your public IP address and the external port number. For example:

```
ssh your-user-name@your-public-ip -p 2222
```

Remember to replace "your-user-name" with your actual username, "your-public-ip" with your actual public IP address, and "2222" with your chosen external port number.

Remember that using a non-standard port isn't a substitute for other security measures. Always ensure you have a strong, unique password for your SSH user, or better yet, set up key-based authentication. And keep your Raspberry Pi and its software up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

can I set the external host as the router public ip?

Yes, the "external host" (in some routers, it's called "WAN IP" or "Public IP") is the IP address provided by your internet service provider (ISP) and is what you use to access your home network (and thus your Raspberry Pi) from the internet. 

In most cases, your router automatically manages your public IP address. You usually don't have to manually input your public IP anywhere in the port forwarding rules. 

If there is a field in your router's port forwarding setup that is asking for an "External Host" or "WAN IP," it could be for one of the following reasons:

1. The router supports binding port forwarding rules to a specific external IP. This would restrict the rule to only apply when your WAN IP is a specific value. This is not common and is usually not necessary.

2. The field is actually for specifying a range of external IPs that are allowed to use the port forwarding rule. In this case, you'd typically leave it blank or set it to allow all IPs, unless you want to restrict access to a specific IP or range of IPs.

3. The field is incorrectly labeled, and it's actually for something else. In this case, you might want to consult the manual for your router or contact the manufacturer's support.

If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to consult the documentation for your specific router or contact the manufacturer's support. The exact steps and terminology can vary significantly between different models and brands of routers.

The fact I'm in Mexico could be the reason? They say you have a shared ip

In some regions, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use a technique called "Carrier-Grade NAT" or CGNAT. This is common in areas with IPv4 address shortages. 

With CGNAT, several customers share the same public IPv4 address and are only distinguished by different port numbers. This can cause problems for port forwarding, because the ISP's equipment, not your router, controls the NAT (Network Address Translation). This makes it impossible to forward ports in the traditional sense, because you don't have a unique public IP address.

You can usually determine if you're behind CGNAT by looking at your router's WAN (Wide Area Network) IP address. If it's a private IP address (common private IP address ranges are 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255), then you're likely behind CGNAT.

If you're behind CGNAT, there are a few possible solutions:

1. **Contact your ISP**: Some ISPs can provide you with a unique public IP address, either for free or for an additional charge.

2. **Use a VPN service**: A VPN service can provide you with a unique public IP address. Some VPN services also support port forwarding.

3. **Use a cloud server**: If you just want to access services on your Raspberry Pi from the internet, you could consider setting up a small cloud server (for example, on DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure, etc.) with a unique public IP address, and then creating a VPN or SSH tunnel from your Raspberry Pi to the cloud server.

Please be aware that making your Raspberry Pi publicly accessible on the internet can have security implications. Ensure you have appropriate security measures in place, such as strong, unique passwords and up-to-date software, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

That's how it looks if I set ssh to my port fw. How config? Remember my device ssh port is 52000

Your settings should be something like this:

- **Internal Host:** `192.168.101.4` (this should be the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi)
- **External Source IP Address:** leave this blank (unless you know the specific external IP addresses that will be accessing your Raspberry Pi; if blank, any external IP can access your Pi)
- **Protocol:** `TCP` (SSH uses TCP)
- **Internal port number:** `52000` (the port on which your SSH server on your Raspberry Pi is listening)
- **External port number:** Any number between `1024` and `49151` that you prefer (this is the port you'll connect to from the outside world; it doesn't have to match the internal port number, but it can if you prefer)

Note: The "external source port number" field doesn't typically need to be set for a standard SSH setup. 

Once you apply these settings, you should be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH from an external network using the command:

```
ssh your-user-name@your-public-ip -p your-external-port
```

Replace `your-user-name` with your actual username, `your-public-ip` with your actual public IP address, and `your-external-port` with the external port number you chose. Remember, you'll need to update the `your-public-ip` part of this command whenever your public IP changes unless you use a dynamic DNS service.

didn't work. How to set it up using nordvpn?

Setting up remote access to a home server while connected to a VPN like NordVPN can be quite tricky due to the way VPNs work. VPNs encrypt your traffic and route it through their servers. This means that when you're connected to a VPN, your public IP address is actually the IP address of the VPN server you're connected to, and not the IP address your ISP has assigned to your router. 

When you're trying to set up remote access to a server on your home network, you typically do this by opening a port on your router and forwarding traffic on that port to your server. However, when you're connected to a VPN, your traffic doesn't go through your router, it goes through the VPN. This means that opening a port on your router won't allow you to access your server when you're connected to the VPN.

There are a few ways to get around this:

1. **Split Tunneling**: Some VPNs offer a feature called split tunneling that allows you to choose which traffic goes through the VPN and which traffic doesn't. If NordVPN supports this, you could potentially set it up so that your SSH traffic doesn't go through the VPN. This way, you could still access your Raspberry Pi remotely using your ISP-assigned IP address.

2. **VPN Port Forwarding**: Some VPNs support port forwarding. If NordVPN supports this, you could potentially set up a port forward on the VPN server that points to your Raspberry Pi. This would allow you to connect to your Raspberry Pi at the IP address of the VPN server. However, note that this might require a static IP address from NordVPN, which might be an additional cost.

3. **Use a different method for remote access**: Instead of trying to directly SSH into your Raspberry Pi, you could use a different method for remote access that works with VPNs. For example, you could use a remote desktop tool like TeamViewer, which works by establishing a connection through TeamViewer's servers rather than directly from your device to your Raspberry Pi.

Note that all of these methods have potential security implications and you should carefully consider these before implementing them. As always, ensure your Raspberry Pi is properly secured, keep all your software up-to-date, and consider using additional security measures like a firewall and intrusion detection/prevention.

so even if I still use vpn I need to rely in my ISP?

If you want to access your server directly over the internet while you're connected to a VPN, the direct server access path will need to bypass the VPN, which means it will rely on your ISP's connection. This is because when you're connected to a VPN, your public IP address is the IP address of the VPN server, not your home IP address. Hence, to directly connect to your server from the outside, you'll need to use the public IP address given by your ISP, not the one from the VPN.

However, there are ways to still use the VPN for accessing your server. You could potentially use a VPN that supports port forwarding. In this case, you would set up a port forward on the VPN server that forwards traffic to your server. You would then connect to the public IP address of the VPN server, not your home IP address. But note that not all VPN services offer this, and those that do often require a higher-tier plan or additional payment.

Alternatively, if you just want to secure your connection to your home server, you could consider setting up your own VPN server on your home network. Then, when you're away from home, you would connect to your home VPN, and then connect to your server. This would secure your connection without needing a third-party VPN service. Tools like OpenVPN or WireGuard can be used to set up your own VPN server.

Regardless of the method you choose, remember that opening up your server to the outside world can create security risks, so be sure to take appropriate precautions, like using strong, unique passwords, enabling 2-factor authentication if possible, keeping your server software updated, and using a firewall and other security measures.

In my huawei router I set the static ip to 192.168.101.5 despite it's showing in 101.4.  In the port mapping, I have the internal host at 192.168.101.4 and then it shows the name of the device. I still don't know what to put in the external source ip address. It asks me for the internal port number (all ports in ranges). I put the internal as 52000--52000, external port number 22-22 and external source port number (which I don't understand) at 22--22. What am I doing wrong here?

Let's clarify the port forwarding settings:

1. **Internal Host**: This is the private (local) IP address of the device to which you want to forward traffic, i.e., the Raspberry Pi. In your case, this should be 192.168.101.4 or 192.168.101.5, depending on which one your Raspberry Pi is currently using.

2. **Internal Port**: This is the port on your Raspberry Pi to which you want to forward traffic. For SSH, this is usually port 22 (unless you've changed it).

3. **External Port**: This is the port that will be visible to the outside world. This can be any valid port number, but for security reasons, it's often a good idea to choose something other than the default SSH port (22). For example, you could use 52000 as you suggested. 

4. **External Source IP Address**: This field allows you to restrict incoming traffic to the forwarded port by the source IP address. If you want to be able to connect from any IP address, you should leave this field blank or set it to a value that represents any IP (like 0.0.0.0, if that's allowed by your router).

5. **External Source Port Number**: This is generally not required for port forwarding. Source ports are typically chosen randomly by the client (the machine you're connecting from), so it's generally not useful to specify a source port.

Based on the information you've given, here are the settings I would suggest:

- Internal Host: 192.168.101.4 (or 192.168.101.5, whichever your Raspberry Pi is using)
- Internal Port: 22
- External Port: 52000
- External Source IP Address: blank (or 0.0.0.0 if it requires a value)
- External Source Port Number: blank (or a wide range like 1-65535 if it requires a value)

Please note that the exact terminology used and the available options can vary between different router models. If you're unsure about a setting, consult your router's manual or contact Huawei support. 

After setting this up, you should be able to SSH into your Raspberry Pi from an external network using your public IP and port 52000. You would use a command like this: `ssh username@your-public-ip -p 52000`.

Do I need to use the device name in the router or can I use the ssh user

When configuring port forwarding on your router, you generally need to specify the internal host by its IP address. Some routers also allow you to select the device by its name from a list, in which case the router translates this to the appropriate IP address. This does not usually involve any usernames.

The username you're referring to (the SSH username) is not relevant for the router or port forwarding configuration. It's used when you're trying to establish a connection via SSH. For example, if your username on the Raspberry Pi is `pi`, you would use the following command to connect:

```bash
ssh pi@your-public-ip -p 52000
```

In this command, `pi` is the username, `your-public-ip` is the public IP address that your ISP assigns to your router, and `52000` is the external port number that you've configured for SSH in your router's port forwarding settings.

Could the problem be that my huawei router is only a repeater and not the main source of wifi for my home?

Yes, that could be the problem. When you're using your Huawei router as a repeater, it's not directly connected to the internet. Instead, it extends the wireless signal from your primary router. This means that the primary router is the one receiving your public IP address from your ISP.

To use port forwarding in this case, you'd have to configure it on your primary router, not the Huawei repeater. The primary router is the one that manages the incoming internet connection and thus, it's the only one that can correctly set up port forwarding rules.

You'll need to set a static IP for your Raspberry Pi in the primary router's settings (not the Huawei repeater's settings), and then set up the port forwarding rule in the primary router to forward incoming connections on your chosen port to the Raspberry Pi's static IP.

If it's not feasible to configure port forwarding on your primary router, you might need to consider other methods to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, such as setting up a VPN or using a service like ngrok, which allows you to expose local servers to the internet without needing to configure port forwarding. Be aware that these methods can also have security implications and should be configured carefully.

Tell me how to configure nordVPM in my raspberry 

NordVPN is one of the most popular VPN services that you can use to secure your Raspberry Pi's internet connection. It provides software specifically for use with the Raspberry Pi.

Here are the general steps to install and configure NordVPN on your Raspberry Pi:

1. Update your Raspberry Pi's software repositories:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install OpenVPN, which NordVPN uses to establish a secure connection:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

3. Download and install the NordVPN Linux client:

```bash
wget -qnc https://repo.nordvpn.com/deb/nordvpn/debian/pool/main/nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nordvpn
```

4. Log in to the NordVPN client using your NordVPN username and password:

```bash
nordvpn login
```

5. Connect to a NordVPN server. You can specify a country, number, or use the 'auto' option to automatically connect to the recommended server:

```bash
nordvpn connect auto
```

6. Verify that you are connected to the VPN:

```bash
nordvpn status
```

Keep in mind that these instructions might change over time, so you should check the official NordVPN website for the latest instructions.

Also, remember that using a VPN service will slow down your network speed to some extent because your data has to be encrypted and then sent to the VPN server before reaching its final destination. For this reason, it's recommended to choose a VPN server close to your location to minimize the impact on speed.

Remember that if your NordVPN subscription expires or if there are any issues with the VPN service, your Raspberry Pi might lose its connection to the internet. So keep track of your subscription status and regularly check that the VPN is functioning correctly.

So then I can login regularly to my pi or would need to check my ip first? Remember I’m trying to access it publicly 

Once you've configured NordVPN on your Raspberry Pi, your Pi will be assigned an IP address by NordVPN. This IP address is dynamic, which means it changes every time you disconnect and reconnect to NordVPN. Because of this, you won't be able to directly SSH into your Raspberry Pi using its NordVPN IP address.

In order to access your Raspberry Pi remotely over SSH when it's connected to a VPN like NordVPN, you would typically need to configure your VPN to allow inbound connections, or set up what's called a VPN 'port forwarding' rule. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, NordVPN does not support inbound connections or port forwarding due to their policy to ensure privacy and security for their users.

Therefore, to remotely SSH into your Raspberry Pi while it's connected to NordVPN, you have a few options:

1. **Use a Reverse SSH Tunnel**: This is a method where your Raspberry Pi would establish an SSH connection to another machine that you can access, and it creates a 'tunnel' back to itself. You would SSH into the Raspberry Pi through this tunnel. This requires another machine that's accessible over the internet.

2. **Use a different VPN service that supports port forwarding**: There are other VPN services out there that allow port forwarding, which would enable you to SSH into your Raspberry Pi from a remote location.

3. **Use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Service with a VPN that supports it**: Some VPN services allow the use of DDNS services which give your device a consistent hostname to connect to. Note that this method still requires a VPN service that supports inbound connections.

Please be aware that all these methods have their own potential security implications and challenges. It's essential to ensure your systems are secure and up-to-date, and that you follow best practices for securing your SSH server and VPN.

If your primary need is to securely access your home network and Raspberry Pi, you might also consider setting up your own VPN server on a device in your home network, rather than connecting your Raspberry Pi to a VPN service like NordVPN. This way, you can connect to your home VPN while you're away, and then access your Raspberry Pi as if you were home. This requires careful setup to secure the VPN server, but it would give you control over your own setup and the ability to access all your home network devices.

So I need to connect my pi directly to the main router or it’s still accessible through the huawei extension?

When setting up remote access to your Raspberry Pi, it is generally simpler and more reliable to have the Raspberry Pi connected directly to your main router. This is because routers, when acting as WiFi extenders or repeaters, sometimes limit the types of network traffic they allow. They might also double-NAT the network, which can add complexity to port forwarding configurations.

If you are having trouble accessing your Raspberry Pi remotely while it is connected to the Huawei repeater, the first troubleshooting step I would recommend is to try connecting it directly to your main router. This will help you determine if the issue is with the Huawei device's configuration or if it lies elsewhere.

However, it should technically be possible to set up remote access with the Raspberry Pi connected through the Huawei repeater, as long as the repeater is correctly configured to pass through the necessary network traffic. The exact setup would depend on the specific capabilities and settings of the Huawei device, so you may need to consult the device's manual or support resources for more information.

Remember, for either setup, you would still need to ensure that the proper ports are forwarded from your main router to your Raspberry Pi's local IP address. If your Raspberry Pi is connected to the Huawei repeater, you might need to set up port forwarding rules on both the main router (forwarding to the Huawei device) and the Huawei device (forwarding to the Raspberry Pi).

Additionally, if you plan to access your Raspberry Pi publicly over the internet, it's crucial to secure it appropriately, as this can potentially expose the device to various internet-based threats. Always ensure that your device is up-to-date, uses strong, unique passwords, and implements firewall rules to limit access to necessary services only. Using a VPN for remote access can also add an additional layer of security.

I connected it to the main router and still unable to connect over ssh. Give me commands to troubleshoot (I have a pc out of the internal wifi network and another one outside)

If you are having trouble connecting to your Raspberry Pi over SSH, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Confirm that SSH is running on the Raspberry Pi:** You can check if the SSH server is running by executing the following command on your Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ssh
    ```
   The status should be "active (running)". If it's not, you can start it with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```

2. **Check your Raspberry Pi's local IP address:** Run the following command on your Raspberry Pi to check its IP address:

    ```bash
    hostname -I
    ```

   Make sure the IP address matches the one you are using to connect over SSH and is the one set in your router's port forwarding rule.

3. **Check the SSH port:** By default, SSH uses port 22. If you have changed the SSH port, ensure you are using the correct port when trying to connect.

4. **Check your firewall:** If you have a firewall enabled on your Raspberry Pi, ensure it is allowing incoming connections on your SSH port.

    ```bash
    sudo ufw status
    ```
   
   If the status is active, you should see an entry like "22/tcp ALLOW Anywhere" (or whatever port you are using for SSH). If not, you can allow SSH through the firewall with:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    ```

5. **Check port forwarding rules:** Make sure that your main router is correctly set up to forward incoming connections on your chosen external port to your Raspberry Pi's IP address and SSH port.

6. **Test connection locally:** Try to SSH into your Raspberry Pi from another device on the same network to confirm that SSH is working correctly locally. This can help you narrow down the problem.

    ```bash
    ssh pi@<Raspberry Pi's local IP address>
    ```

7. **Check public IP address:** If you are trying to connect from outside your network, make sure you are using your public IP address, not your local one. You can check your public IP address by typing "What is my IP" into a web search engine.

8. **Try a different SSH client:** Sometimes the issue might be with the SSH client you are using. Try using a different SSH client or connecting from a different device to rule this out.

Remember, if you are connecting from outside your network, you should use your public IP address and the external port you have set in your router's port forwarding rules. The command should look something like this:

```bash
ssh -p <external port> pi@<your public IP address>
```


It is working from within the local network.

That's good news. If you can SSH into your Raspberry Pi from within your local network, then your SSH server is working properly.

The issue might be with the port forwarding setup on your main router or it might be the case that your ISP is blocking inbound connections. Here's what you should do next:

1. **Recheck your Port Forwarding Rules:** Go back to your main router's configuration page and double-check your port forwarding rules. Make sure that you've forwarded the correct external port to the correct internal IP address (the static IP address of your Raspberry Pi) and the correct internal port (your SSH port, probably 22).

2. **Check if ISP is Blocking Ports:** Some ISPs block certain inbound ports. You can check if your ISP is blocking the inbound SSH port by using an online port check tool. There are many available if you search "online port check tool" in a web browser. Use this tool to check your external IP address and the external port you've set in your router's port forwarding rules.

3. **Try a Different External Port:** ISPs are more likely to block lower numbered ports. If you're trying to use a lower numbered external port for SSH (below 1024), try changing your port forwarding rules to use a higher numbered port (above 1024) and see if that solves the issue. Don't forget to update your SSH command to use the new port:

    ```bash
    ssh -p <new external port> pi@<your public IP address>
    ```

4. **DMZ Setting:** As a last resort, you could try using your router's DMZ setting to expose your Raspberry Pi to the internet. This bypasses the router's firewall and forwards all inbound traffic to the DMZ host. However, be aware that this will expose your Raspberry Pi to all inbound internet traffic, not just SSH, so it is less secure. It's best to use DMZ to test if the issue is with your router or ISP, but it's not recommended as a permanent solution.

Remember, if you're trying to SSH from outside your network, you should use your public IP address, not your local one. You can check your public IP address by typing "What is my IP" into a web search engine.

It says my 52000 port is closed but I can access ssh through it locally

If you are able to access your Raspberry Pi through SSH locally using the port 52000, then it means the SSH service on your Raspberry Pi is working correctly, and the port is correctly opened on the Pi itself.

The issue, in this case, lies within the network configuration, likely the port forwarding settings on your main router. Here are some additional steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Double-check the port forwarding settings:** Log into your main router's configuration interface and check the port forwarding settings. Make sure that the internal port is set to 22 (the default SSH port), the external port is set to 52000, and the internal IP address is set to the static IP of your Raspberry Pi. Also, ensure that the protocol is set to TCP (or both).

2. **Ensure your Pi is connected to the main router:** Double-check that your Raspberry Pi is connected to the correct router (the one you're setting port forwarding rules on). If you have more than one router or a mesh network, ensure that your Raspberry Pi is connected to the primary router.

3. **Try setting your router's DMZ to your Raspberry Pi's IP address:** This step will help confirm whether the issue is with your port forwarding settings. The DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) setting forwards all incoming connections to a specific internal IP address, bypassing the router's firewall. If you're able to SSH into your Pi from outside your local network with the DMZ set to your Pi's IP address, then the problem lies with your port forwarding settings. **Please note that using the DMZ reduces the security of your Pi by exposing it to all incoming traffic, not just SSH.** After testing, remember to disable the DMZ.

4. **Check if your ISP blocks inbound connections:** Some Internet Service Providers block inbound connections to residential customers for security reasons. You can contact your ISP's customer support to ask if they block inbound connections on port 52000.

5. **Consider using a different external port:** Sometimes, specific ports can be blocked by ISPs or could be in use by other services. Consider trying a different external port (e.g., 52222) and update the port forwarding rules accordingly.

If none of the above work, your ISP may be using a technology called CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT), which shares a single IP address among multiple customers. This makes it impossible to forward ports since you don't have a unique public IP address. If this is the case, you would need to discuss alternatives with your ISP or consider a different method of accessing your Raspberry Pi remotely, such as through a VPN.

So I'm using TotalPlay in Mexico, is it using CGNAT?

TotalPlay, like many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) worldwide, may use Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) for its residential customers. CGNAT is a technology used by ISPs to share a single IP address among multiple customers. This is a common practice, especially in areas where IPv4 addresses are in short supply.

Using CGNAT can prevent customers from being able to use port forwarding because they do not have a unique public IP address. This might be why you're having issues setting up remote access to your Raspberry Pi.

However, the use of CGNAT can vary based on the specific policies of an ISP, and even among different regions or tiers of service within the same ISP. As such, the best way to confirm whether TotalPlay is using CGNAT in your case is to directly contact TotalPlay's customer service.

If they confirm that they do use CGNAT for your connection, you might be able to request a public IP address, although this often comes with additional costs. If obtaining a public IP address isn't possible or is too costly, you might want to consider alternatives, such as setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or using a third-party service that facilitates remote access without the need for port forwarding.

Tutorial to set the VPN

Sure, I can help guide you on how to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your Raspberry Pi using OpenVPN, a popular open-source VPN solution. However, please note that you will also need to have an OpenVPN server somewhere on the internet that your Raspberry Pi can connect to. This could be a commercial VPN service or your own OpenVPN server hosted on a VPS or cloud provider.

Please note: This tutorial assumes you're using a command line interface and you have sudo privileges.

**Step 1:** Update the Raspberry Pi

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

**Step 2:** Install OpenVPN

```
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

**Step 3:** Download the OpenVPN Configuration File

You should have received an OpenVPN configuration file from your VPN provider. This is usually a `.ovpn` file. You'll need to put this file onto your Raspberry Pi in the `/etc/openvpn` directory. You can transfer the file using `scp`, a USB drive, or another method.

For instance, if you're using `scp`, the command would be:

```
scp /path/to/config.ovpn pi@raspberryPiIP:/home/pi/
```

Then, on the Raspberry Pi, move the `.ovpn` file to the `/etc/openvpn` directory and rename it to `vpn.conf`:

```
sudo mv /home/pi/config.ovpn /etc/openvpn/vpn.conf
```

**Step 4:** Automatically start the VPN connection on boot

Edit the `/etc/default/openvpn` file:

```
sudo nano /etc/default/openvpn
```

Uncomment the line that says `#AUTOSTART="all"`. Just remove the `#` at the beginning of the line. Save and exit (Ctrl + X, Y, Enter).

**Step 5:** Start the VPN

You can start the VPN with the following command:

```
sudo service openvpn start
```

To check that everything is working correctly, you can check the status of the service:

```
sudo service openvpn status
```

That's it! Your Raspberry Pi should now automatically connect to your VPN whenever it starts up. 

Please make sure to replace the placeholder values in the commands above with your actual values. Also, bear in mind that the specific setup might vary depending on your VPN provider, so you should check their documentation for any provider-specific steps.

and then how I'd connect?

Once your Raspberry Pi is set up to connect to the VPN, it's effectively part of that VPN's network. That means you would connect to it just like any other device on the VPN. However, the specific steps can vary depending on how your VPN is set up.

Here are some general steps:

1. **Connect to the VPN from your client device.** Most VPNs provide client software that you can install on your device (PC, smartphone, etc.). You would typically provide your VPN account credentials and then connect to the VPN.

2. **Find the Raspberry Pi's IP address on the VPN.** This can usually be done via your VPN account dashboard. If the IP address of your Raspberry Pi is static on the VPN, you may want to make a note of it for future reference.

3. **Use SSH to connect to the Raspberry Pi.** Open a terminal or command prompt on your client device, and then use the following command, replacing `[raspberryPi-VPN-IP]` with the Raspberry Pi's IP address on the VPN, and `[username]` with your username on the Raspberry Pi:

```
ssh [username]@[raspberryPi-VPN-IP]
```

Please note: If you've changed the SSH port from the default (22), you'll need to include `-p [port]` in the command, replacing `[port]` with the actual port number.

4. **Enter your password.** When prompted, enter your password for the Raspberry Pi. If everything is set up correctly, you should now be connected to the Raspberry Pi over SSH, securely through the VPN.

Remember, the specific steps might vary depending on your VPN provider and configuration. Always check the provider's documentation for any provider-specific instructions.

What is the easiest VPN provider to implement this advice?

There are several VPN providers that are widely recognized for their ease of use, feature sets, and Raspberry Pi compatibility. They usually provide detailed setup instructions on their websites as well. Here are a few options:

1. **NordVPN**: As we previously discussed, NordVPN is one of the leading VPN services and it provides robust support for Raspberry Pi. NordVPN offers a command-line tool for Linux which makes it straightforward to setup on a Raspberry Pi.

2. **ExpressVPN**: ExpressVPN is another top-tier VPN provider with broad platform support. They provide easy-to-follow instructions for setting up a VPN on Raspberry Pi.

3. **Private Internet Access (PIA)**: PIA is known for its strong commitment to privacy and it also provides clear instructions for setting up their VPN service on a Raspberry Pi.

4. **CyberGhost**: This is another good option with comprehensive setup guides for Raspberry Pi.

5. **ProtonVPN**: Created by the team behind ProtonMail, ProtonVPN is recognized for its focus on security and privacy. They provide command-line tool for Linux and instructions for Raspberry Pi setup.

These VPN services are all paid, but they offer strong encryption, good speeds, and have been generally well-reviewed. Whichever you choose, make sure to thoroughly read through their setup instructions, and don't hesitate to reach out to their customer support if you encounter any issues.

Repeat the tutorial, I'll use NordVPN.

Great choice! Here's a tutorial on how to set up NordVPN on your Raspberry Pi:

1. **Update your system**: Always start by updating your system. You can do this by running:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Install OpenVPN**: NordVPN uses the OpenVPN protocol, and we need to install it with this command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install openvpn
   ```

3. **Download NordVPN's OpenVPN configuration files**: To connect to NordVPN servers, we need the specific configuration files. You can download them by running:
   ```
   wget https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip
   ```

4. **Unzip the configuration files**: Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the directory with the servers' configurations:
   ```
   unzip ovpn.zip
   cd ovpn_udp  # Use `ovpn_tcp` if you prefer to use TCP
   ```

5. **Choose a server to connect to**: You can pick any server you want. For example, let's say you want to use the 'us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn' configuration:
   ```
   sudo openvpn us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn
   ```
   Note: Replace 'us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn' with the server you want to connect to. You can find the full list of servers on the NordVPN website.

6. **Enter your NordVPN credentials**: Once you run the previous command, you'll be asked for your NordVPN username and password. Enter them, and you should be connected to the VPN!

Remember, this connection will be active as long as the terminal is open. To disconnect, you can just close the terminal or press `CTRL+C`.

If you want the VPN to run on startup, you will need to set up a systemd service. This is a bit more complex, but NordVPN has a guide on their website.

Once the VPN is set up, you will connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH through the VPN connection. This means that your SSH client will connect to the NordVPN server's IP address, not your Raspberry Pi's local or public IP. NordVPN's servers will then forward your SSH connection to your Raspberry Pi.

How can I test my NordVPN works?

Once you're connected to NordVPN on your Raspberry Pi, you can check the VPN status by checking your public IP address and its location. When connected to a VPN, your public IP address should be changed to the one assigned by your VPN provider (in this case, NordVPN).

Here is a simple way to test:

1. Before you connect to the VPN, check your current public IP address by running the following command:
   ```
   curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip
   ```
   Note this IP address.

2. Connect to NordVPN using the instructions provided earlier.

3. While connected to the VPN, check your public IP address again:
   ```
   curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip
   ```
   Your public IP address should now be different from the one you noted earlier.

4. You can also check the location and ISP of the IP address to confirm it's associated with NordVPN. Run:
   ```
   curl -s https://ipinfo.io/
   ```
   This should return information about your current IP address, including its approximate geographical location and ISP. The ISP should be NordVPN or something similar.

If the public IP address changes after you connect to the VPN, and the new IP address is associated with NordVPN, then your NordVPN setup is working correctly.

2023-07-31 22:13:03 Attempting to establish TCP connection with [AF_INET]192.154.196.17:443 [nonblock]
2023-07-31 22:15:03 TCP: connect to [AF_INET]192.154.196.17:443 failed: Connection timed out

This error message is indicating that the OpenVPN client on your Raspberry Pi is unable to establish a connection to the NordVPN server at the IP address `192.154.196.17` on port `443`. The error is a timeout error, which usually suggests a network-related issue rather than a problem with the VPN configuration itself.

Here are some possible reasons for this issue:

1. **Internet connectivity issues:** Ensure your Raspberry Pi has a stable internet connection. You can test this by trying to ping a well-known site like Google (`ping google.com`). If you're unable to ping Google, then there's likely a problem with your internet connection.

2. **Firewall configuration:** If your network has a firewall, it might be blocking the outgoing connection to the VPN server. Ensure your firewall is allowing outgoing connections on the necessary ports (port `443` in this case).

3. **ISP blocking or throttling VPN traffic:** Some ISPs may block or throttle VPN traffic. If you suspect this is the case, you may need to contact your ISP.

4. **VPN server is down or unreachable:** It's also possible that the specific NordVPN server you're trying to connect to is down or unreachable for some reason. Try connecting to a different NordVPN server.

If none of these suggestions solve the problem, you may need to reach out to NordVPN's support for further assistance.

I added a ufw rule for 443/tcp, do I need to re-run openvpn or ufw?

After changing the firewall rules, you typically do not need to restart the firewall itself, but you should ensure that the new rules are active. In case of UFW, you can check the active rules with:

```
sudo ufw status
```

If your new rule is listed and active, then there is no need to restart UFW.

However, after changing the firewall rules, you should restart the OpenVPN service to attempt a new connection. You can do this with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart openvpn@nordvpn
```

This will stop and then start the `openvpn@nordvpn` service, causing it to attempt a new connection using your updated firewall rules.

The output you provided indicates that the OpenVPN service attempted to start but exited with an error. The key part of the message is `Main PID: 15737 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)` which tells us the process did not start successfully.

To troubleshoot, you can check the OpenVPN log file. OpenVPN usually logs to `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/openvpn.log` depending on the configuration. You can examine these files with the `cat`, `less`, or `tail` commands. For instance:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep openvpn
```

OR

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/openvpn.log
```

This will output the OpenVPN related entries in your log. Look for any error messages or warnings that might provide insight into what is causing OpenVPN to exit. 

Common problems include:

1. Incorrect or missing configuration information in `/etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf`.
2. Problems with the network interface that OpenVPN is attempting to use.
3. Network connectivity issues.

Also, please ensure you have the correct OpenVPN configuration files from NordVPN. You can download the recommended .ovpn file from the NordVPN website. This .ovpn file should be renamed to `nordvpn.conf` and placed in the `/etc/openvpn` directory.

Jul 31 22:19:07 asfn342827df ovpn-nordvpn[15605]: Options error: In [CMD-LINE]:1: Error opening configuration file: /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf

The error message `Error opening configuration file: /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf` indicates that OpenVPN is unable to open the configuration file at `/etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf`. This is usually because the file does not exist, is named incorrectly, or the permissions are set incorrectly. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check if the file exists**: The simplest way to do this is with the `ls` command:

    ```bash
    ls /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf
    ```

    If the file exists, you should see it listed. If not, you'll see an error message. If the file does not exist, you'll need to create it or move the correct configuration file to that location.

2. **Check the file permissions**: The permissions on the configuration file may prevent OpenVPN from opening it. You can check the permissions with the `ls -l` command:

    ```bash
    ls -l /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf
    ```

    This will output the file permissions in the form `-rw-r--r--`. The `openvpn` process needs to have read access to the file. If it doesn't, you can change the permissions with the `chmod` command:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf
    ```

3. **Check the file's content**: You should also check to make sure the configuration file is correctly formatted and includes the correct information. You can view the file with the `cat` command:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf
    ```

    This will output the contents of the file to your terminal. Make sure the configuration settings are correct according to the NordVPN OpenVPN configuration instructions.

If the file is missing, you will need to download the OpenVPN configuration file from NordVPN again and move it to `/etc/openvpn/` and rename it to `nordvpn.conf`. You can do this with the `mv` command, for example:

```bash
sudo mv /path/to/downloaded/file.ovpn /etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf
```

Replace `/path/to/downloaded/file.ovpn` with the actual path and filename of the downloaded configuration file.

give me the public url to nordvpn.conf

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, NordVPN does not provide a public URL directly to a single `nordvpn.conf` file. Instead, NordVPN offers a variety of configuration files for different servers and uses.

Here's how you can obtain NordVPN OpenVPN configuration files:

1. Go to NordVPN's [server recommendation page](https://nordvpn.com/servers/tools/).

2. Choose the "Show advanced options" link.

3. In the "Select server type" dropdown, choose OpenVPN (TCP) or OpenVPN (UDP), depending on your preference.

4. Click on "Show available protocols".

5. You will now see a "Download config" button. Click on this to download the configuration file.

The downloaded file is an OpenVPN configuration file that you can use with the OpenVPN client. The exact contents and settings in the file will depend on the server you selected.

Remember to rename and move this file to `/etc/openvpn/nordvpn.conf` in your Raspberry Pi for the OpenVPN service to find and use it. You can transfer the file to your Raspberry Pi using SCP (Secure Copy), SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), or any other method you prefer.

Keep in mind, every time you want to change your server, you will have to download a new configuration file and replace your existing one. This is different from NordVPN's proprietary software, which lets you easily switch between servers. This is one reason why using NordVPN's proprietary software is more user-friendly, but that software may not be available on all platforms.

Please note that this information might be outdated or changed after my last training data in September, 2021. Always refer to the official NordVPN website or their customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

This is the link, commands to set it in the nordvpn.conf
https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/files/ovpn_legacy/servers/mx52.nordvpn.com.tcp443.ovpn

You can download and set this file as your `nordvpn.conf` with the following commands:

```bash
# Move to OpenVPN directory
cd /etc/openvpn

# Download the configuration file
sudo wget https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/files/ovpn_legacy/servers/mx52.nordvpn.com.tcp443.ovpn

# Rename the downloaded file to nordvpn.conf
sudo mv mx52.nordvpn.com.tcp443.ovpn nordvpn.conf
```

After executing these commands, the file `mx52.nordvpn.com.tcp443.ovpn` will be downloaded to your `/etc/openvpn` directory and renamed to `nordvpn.conf`.

This file will be used by the OpenVPN service as the main configuration file when the service starts.

Don't forget to restart the OpenVPN service after making changes to the configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvpn@nordvpn
```

Finally, remember to check the status of the service to confirm it's working properly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status openvpn@nordvpn
```

This should help you setup the NordVPN client using the provided configuration file. Please let me know if you encounter any issues.

I connected to the ip that it has now over the 52000 port but the ssh connection is not responding

If you can't connect via SSH over the port 52000, there could be a few reasons:

1. The VPN service is running and has changed the public IP, but port 52000 is not forwarded through the VPN. Remember, using a VPN can affect the way port forwarding works.

2. SSH server is not correctly configured to listen to the port 52000.

3. Firewall (like ufw) may be blocking the connection.

Here's what you can do to troubleshoot:

1. Check the SSH Server configuration:
   
   Make sure that your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file has the line `Port 52000` to ensure SSH is listening on the correct port. If you make changes, remember to restart the SSH service with `sudo systemctl restart ssh`.

2. Check your Firewall:

   Verify if ufw is allowing connections to port 52000 with the command: `sudo ufw status`. If it's not, you can add a rule to allow it: `sudo ufw allow 52000/tcp`.

3. Check Port Forwarding on VPN:

   Most VPN services do not support port forwarding, which can be an issue when trying to access your server from the outside. Check if NordVPN supports it and how to set it up. If it's not supported, you might need to reconsider your setup or find a VPN provider that supports port forwarding.

In general, setting up a server accessible over the internet with a VPN can be quite complex due to these issues. If it's feasible, you might want to consider using a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. These platforms provide public IPs and handle a lot of the networking complexity for you.


so if it doesn't support port forward, what can I do?

If NordVPN (or any other VPN service) doesn't support port forwarding, it becomes a bit tricky to make your Raspberry Pi publicly accessible over SSH from outside your local network. But don't worry, there are a few workarounds available:

1. **Reverse SSH Tunnel:** If you have access to a second server with a public IP (like a cloud-based virtual server), you can create a reverse SSH tunnel from your Raspberry Pi to that server. This way, you can SSH into the second server and then directly access your Raspberry Pi through the established tunnel.

   Here's a basic example of how you'd set this up:

   ```bash
   ssh -f -N -R 2222:localhost:22 user@your_public_server
   ```

   In this example, you're creating a reverse (-R) tunnel that connects port 2222 on your_public_server to port 22 on the Raspberry Pi. The -f and -N options tell SSH to run in the background and not execute any commands. After running this command on your Raspberry Pi, you could SSH into your_public_server from anywhere, and then SSH to your Raspberry Pi through the established tunnel with `ssh -p 2222 localhost`.

2. **Tor Onion Services:** Another approach is to use Tor and set up your Raspberry Pi as an Onion Service. This would allow you to access it over the Tor network from anywhere, even though it's behind a VPN. This method is very secure and works even if your VPN doesn't support port forwarding, but it does require the client to use Tor to connect.

3. **Switch VPN Providers:** Some VPN providers support port forwarding. If it's crucial for your setup, consider switching to a VPN provider that supports this feature. 

4. **Use a Cloud-Based Service:** Services like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), [Dataplicity](https://www.dataplicity.com/), [Remote.it](https://www.remote.it/) etc., allow you to expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels. They are quite easy to set up and often free for limited use.

Remember that exposing your Raspberry Pi to the public internet can have security implications, so always make sure it's secure and keep it up to date.


So in Mexico where ISP don't have static ips, how can I public my raspberry server the simplest way?

For situations where you're dealing with a dynamic IP address and your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn't offer static IP addresses, you can use a Dynamic DNS service to assign a fixed domain name to your dynamic IP.

Here's a simplified step-by-step guide for doing this:

1. **Choose a Dynamic DNS service**: Some popular choices include No-IP, DynDNS, and DuckDNS. Some of these services offer free tiers, so you might not need to pay anything.

2. **Create an account and choose a domain name**: Once you've chosen your service, sign up for an account and select a domain name. This will typically be a subdomain like `yourname.service.com`.

3. **Set up Dynamic DNS on your router**: Many routers have an option in their settings for Dynamic DNS. You'll need to enter your account details and your chosen domain name.

   - If your router does not support this feature, or if you're using a complex network setup, you may need to run a Dynamic DNS client on your Raspberry Pi or another device on your network. This software will update the Dynamic DNS service with your current IP address whenever it changes.

4. **Set up port forwarding**: You'll still need to set up port forwarding on your router to forward traffic from the outside world to your Raspberry Pi. The exact steps for this depend on your router model, but you'll generally need to specify the port number and the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

5. **Access your Raspberry Pi**: Once everything is set up, you can access your Raspberry Pi from anywhere using your chosen domain name, like so: `ssh -p <your_port> pi@yourname.service.com`.

Please note that this does expose your Raspberry Pi to the internet, so ensure that you've taken appropriate security measures. This includes using a strong password, keeping your Raspberry Pi updated, and ideally disabling password-based SSH login in favor of public key authentication.

Also, remember that even though Dynamic DNS can help you expose your Raspberry Pi server to the internet, it doesn't provide any kind of encryption or traffic obfuscation. For that, you would need a VPN or another kind of secure tunnel.

Installed rust in raspberry pi 4 but it only shows version of rustup, not rustc nor cargo



When you install Rust using `rustup`, it installs the Rust toolchain which includes `rustc` (the compiler) and `cargo` (the build tool and package manager). If you've installed Rust using `rustup`, but you're unable to access `rustc` or `cargo`, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **PATH Issue**: The most common issue is that the installation path for Rust binaries is not in your system's PATH. By default, `rustup` installs Rust to the user directory and adds it to the PATH for the current session. If the terminal is closed and reopened, unless the PATH has been permanently modified, you may not have access.

    To fix this, you can manually add the default Rust path to your shell profile. For `bash`, typically this involves adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    After adding, source the profile to activate the changes:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Or, if you've added it to `~/.bash_profile`:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

2. **Incomplete Installation**: Sometimes, an interruption or error during installation might result in an incomplete setup. In such cases, it may be best to reinstall. First, you can uninstall rustup:

    ```bash
    rustup self uninstall
    ```

    And then reinstall using the standard installation command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. **Different Shell Session**: If you've just installed Rust and are trying to access `rustc` or `cargo` from a different terminal session than the one you used for installation, it might not recognize the commands. Either use the terminal session you installed Rust in, or start a new session and ensure that the PATH is set up correctly.

After ensuring one of the above solutions, try running:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

Both should now display their respective version numbers.

stable-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu installed - (error reading rustc version)

The error message `stable-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu installed - (error reading rustc version)` suggests that `rustup` recognizes the channel and target platform, but is having difficulty reading the version of the `rustc` compiler.

Here are steps to diagnose and possibly fix the issue:

1. **Verify the Installation**: 
   
   First, ensure that the toolchain is properly installed:

   ```bash
   rustup toolchain list
   ```

   This will list all installed toolchains. Ensure that `stable-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` is present.

2. **Reinstall the Toolchain**:

   It might be possible that the toolchain installation got corrupted. Try reinstalling it:

   ```bash
   rustup toolchain uninstall stable-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
   rustup toolchain install stable-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
   ```

   After the reinstallation, try checking the versions again:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

3. **Check rustc Directly**:

   Navigate to the Rust bin directory and try executing `rustc` directly:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.cargo/bin
   ./rustc --version
   ```

   This can give you more detailed error messages if `rustc` is failing to start for some reason.

4. **Ensure Enough Memory and Disk Space**:

   The Raspberry Pi, especially if it's running multiple applications, can run out of memory. Ensure you have enough free memory and disk space. Use commands like `free -h` for memory and `df -h` for disk space.

5. **Dependencies**:

   Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. While Rust mostly comes with everything it needs, there could be system dependencies that might be missing.

6. **Logs & Error Messages**:

   Often, detailed logs or error messages can provide insights into what might be going wrong. Check if there are any logs in the `~/.cargo/` directory or any error messages when trying to run `rustc` directly.

7. **Reinstall Rustup**:

   If everything else fails, try to uninstall `rustup` entirely and then reinstall it:

   ```bash
   rustup self uninstall
   ```

   Then reinstall:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

8. **Seek Help**:

   If you're still facing issues after trying the above steps, consider reaching out to the Rust community, either through the [users forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/) or [Rust's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang). They might have come across similar issues, especially related to specific platforms like the Raspberry Pi.

Remember, error messages can be quite informative. If there's any specific error message you get during these steps, please provide it as it can offer further clues into the issue.

there is a rustc binary but trying to execute it says no file or directory rustc

If you are receiving a "No such file or directory" error when trying to execute a binary that clearly exists, it could be due to a couple of reasons, especially on a system like the Raspberry Pi which uses the ARM architecture:

1. **Missing Dynamic Libraries**:
   
   The binary might be dynamically linked to some libraries that are not present on your system. You can use `ldd` to check the shared libraries required by the binary:

   ```bash
   ldd $(which rustc)
   ```

   If any libraries are marked as "not found", you will need to install them.

2. **Wrong Binary Format**:

   It's possible that the binary format is not compatible with your system. For example, you might be trying to run a binary compiled for a different architecture.

   To check the binary type, use:

   ```bash
   file $(which rustc)
   ```

   This will tell you the type of the binary and for which architecture it was compiled. Ensure that it matches your Raspberry Pi's architecture.

3. **Corrupted Installation**:
   
   The Rust installation might be corrupted. As previously suggested, uninstalling and then reinstalling Rust might resolve the issue.

4. **Filesystem Issues**:

   It's less likely, but possible, that there's a filesystem or disk error that's causing problems. You can check the filesystem with `fsck` (though make sure to do so during a reboot or when the filesystem is unmounted).

5. **Kernel & Binary Compatibility**:
   
   There might be a compatibility issue between the binary and the kernel you're running on your Raspberry Pi. Ensure your Raspberry Pi's OS and kernel are up to date.

6. **PATH Variable**:
   
   Ensure your PATH variable includes the location of the rustc binary. If `~/.cargo/bin` is not in your PATH, you may face issues. Check with:

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

If after checking all these points the problem persists, consider seeking direct assistance from the Rust community, as they might have specific insights or experience with similar issues, especially on the Raspberry Pi.

uninstall and reinstall aws v2 in raspberry pi 4

To uninstall and reinstall the AWS CLI version 2 (v2) on a Raspberry Pi 4, follow these steps:

### Uninstall AWS CLI v2:

1. If you installed AWS CLI v2 using the standard method (`awscliv2.zip`), you can simply remove the `aws` binary:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/aws /usr/local/aws-cli
   ```

2. If you've used another method for installation, you might need to adjust the above command accordingly or use the package manager that you initially used for installation.

### Reinstall AWS CLI v2:

As of my last update in 2022, AWS doesn't provide a native ARM build of AWS CLI v2 for
