why causing trouble?



It seems that the issue is related to your SSH configuration, specifically how the `github-personal` host is being interpreted when trying to connect to GitHub.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the SSH key authentication**: Make sure that the SSH key specified in `IdentityFile` (in this case, `/Users/spectech/.ssh/id_ed25519_old_personal`) is properly added to your SSH agent and associated with your GitHub account.

You can verify that your key is loaded with the following command:
```bash
ssh-add -l
```
If itâ€™s not listed, you can add it with:
```bash
ssh-add /Users/spectech/.ssh/id_ed25519_old_personal
```

2. **Test SSH connection to GitHub**: To check if the connection works with the `github-personal` configuration, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github-personal
```
This should respond with something like:
```
Hi <your-username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
If not, there might be an issue with the SSH key or the GitHub configuration.

3. **Correct the remote URL format**: Ensure that the remote URL is correctly specified. The remote URL should follow this pattern:
```bash
git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
```
For your case, it seems the format is:
```bash
git@github-personal/lolo.international.git
```
It should be:
```bash
git@github-personal:<your-username>/lolo.international.git
```
Try editing your remote by running:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-personal:<your-username>/lolo.international.git
```

4. **Verify GitHub SSH Key**: Check that the SSH key you're using (`id_ed25519_old_personal`) is properly added to your GitHub account under **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.

After making these adjustments, try pulling from the repository again:
```bash
git pull origin assets
```

nvim execution proper path, i have it in the downloads folder

If you have `nvim` (Neovim) in your `Downloads` folder and want to run it, you can either:

1. **Run it directly from the Downloads folder**: Navigate to the `Downloads` folder and run Neovim like this:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ./nvim
   ```

   If Neovim is inside a specific folder in `Downloads`, you will need to navigate to that subfolder first, for example:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/nvim-linux64
   ./nvim
   ```

2. **Add Neovim to your PATH**: If you want to run `nvim` from any directory without needing to specify the full path, you should add it to your system's `PATH`.

   Here's how to do it:

   - Find the location of the Neovim executable in your `Downloads` folder.
   - Add the Neovim executable path to your `PATH`. Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`) and add the following line:

     For example, if your Neovim binary is in `~/Downloads/nvim-linux64`, you would do:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/nvim-linux64"
     ```

   - Save the file and source it:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # Or source ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell
     ```

   Now you should be able to run `nvim` from anywhere by simply typing:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

downloaded it from https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.0/nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz


Great! Since you've downloaded the Neovim `nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz` file, here's how you can set it up on your system properly:

### Steps to install Neovim on macOS from the downloaded archive:

1. **Navigate to the Downloads folder**:
   Open your terminal and go to the `Downloads` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```

2. **Extract the tar.gz file**:
   Extract the contents of the tar.gz file:
   ```bash
   tar -xvzf nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz
   ```
   This will create a folder named something like `nvim-macos-arm64`.

3. **Move Neovim to a proper location**:
   Itâ€™s a good practice to move the Neovim binary to a location that is in your systemâ€™s `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

   To move Neovim, you can do the following:
   ```bash
   sudo mv nvim-macos-arm64/bin/nvim /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. **Check the installation**:
   Once moved, you should be able to run Neovim by simply typing:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   You can check if it was installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   nvim --version
   ```

### Optional: Add Neovim to your PATH (if not moved to `/usr/local/bin`)

If you prefer not to move Neovim to `/usr/local/bin`, you can still run it from its location by adding it to your `PATH`. Here's how:

1. Open your shell configuration file, e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc  # Or ~/.bashrc, depending on the shell you're using
   ```

2. Add the following line (adjust the path if necessary):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/nvim-macos-arm64/bin"
   ```

3. Save the file and source it:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # Or source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Now you should be able to run `nvim` from any directory.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!

Press ENTER or type command to continue

The error you're encountering likely stems from some misconfiguration or missing packages in your Neovim setup, especially with Lua modules like `vim.uri` and the missing `syntax.vim` file. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### Steps to fix the issue:

1. **Ensure Neovim is properly installed**:
   - Since you downloaded Neovim manually, make sure the installation is complete and no files are missing. If you're still seeing errors, consider reinstalling using a package manager like `Homebrew`, which handles dependencies more efficiently:
     ```bash
     brew install neovim
     ```

2. **Check for Lua dependencies**:
   The error `module 'vim.uri' not found` suggests that Lua modules required by Neovim are missing. You might need to install the missing Lua modules or update your Neovim configuration.
   
   First, try clearing your Neovim cache and reinstalling your plugins:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
   nvim
   ```

   If you're using `lazy.nvim` or another plugin manager, it will re-download your plugins upon restart. Make sure your plugins are properly set up in your `init.lua` or `init.vim`.

3. **Install the `vim.uri` module**:
   - You might need to explicitly install the `vim.uri` module if it's missing. This could be part of a specific plugin or dependency. Check your plugin manager configuration to ensure all required plugins are being installed properly. If you're using `lazy.nvim`, make sure you have the correct setup in `init.lua`.

4. **Verify Neovim runtime files**:
   The error `E484: Can't open file /usr/local/share/nvim/syntax/syntax.vim` suggests that Neovim's runtime files, including syntax definitions, are missing or incorrectly placed. Ensure that the `runtime` files are properly installed.

   If you've manually installed Neovim, you might not have the necessary runtime files. Try downloading the runtime files from the official Neovim repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
   cd neovim
   make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   sudo make install
   ```

   Alternatively, if you want to install the runtime files without building Neovim from source, download the pre-built runtime files:
   ```bash
   curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/stable/nvim-macos.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf nvim-macos.tar.gz
   sudo mv nvim-osx64/share/nvim/runtime /usr/local/share/nvim/
   ```

5. **Verify Plugin Configuration**:
   Since you are using `lazy.nvim`, ensure your `init.lua` configuration is set up properly. Make sure that you're calling `lazy.nvim` correctly and that all plugins have been installed. You can try:
   ```bash
   nvim
   :Lazy install
   ```

6. **Check Lua Version**:
   Ensure you're using the correct version of Lua, as Neovim requires Lua 5.1 or newer for its Lua-based configuration. You can check the version with:
   ```bash
   lua -v
   ```

After these steps, try running Neovim again:
```bash
nvim
```

If you still encounter issues, feel free to share any new error messages.

I want to install nvchad on top of it, maybe went to the wrong route

User wants to install NvChad on top of Neovim.

Model set context updated.

If you're looking to install NvChad on top of Neovim, thatâ€™s a great choice as NvChad provides a highly customizable and feature-rich Neovim setup. Hereâ€™s how you can install NvChad correctly, step-by-step:

### Steps to install NvChad on Neovim:

1. **Backup your current Neovim configuration (optional but recommended)**:
   If you already have an existing Neovim configuration, itâ€™s a good idea to back it up to avoid conflicts:
   ```bash
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
   ```

2. **Clone the NvChad repository**:
   Run the following command to clone NvChad into your Neovim configuration directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
   ```

3. **Start Neovim**:
   After cloning NvChad, open Neovim. It will automatically install all required plugins:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   Upon the first startup, NvChad will install the necessary plugins, which may take a few minutes.

4. **Customize your NvChad setup (optional)**:
   If you want to further customize NvChad, you can create a custom configuration in `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/`.

   - To see all the configuration options and how to customize them, you can refer to the NvChad [docs](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install).

### Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues:
- **Make sure your Neovim version is up to date**, as NvChad depends on a modern version of Neovim (v0.10.0 or later).
- You can reinstall Neovim using Homebrew if necessary:
  ```bash
  brew install neovim
  ```

Now you should have a fully functional NvChad setup on top of Neovim. Let me know if you encounter any specific issues during the installation!

E484: Cant open file /usr/local/share/nvim/syntax/syntax.vim after I moved it from downloads to the bin folder you suggested. 



The error `E484: Can't open file /usr/local/share/nvim/syntax/syntax.vim` occurs because Neovim cannot find the runtime files, which include syntax definitions, keymaps, and other configurations that Neovim needs to function properly.

When you manually move the Neovim binary to `/usr/local/bin/`, only the executable is moved, but the runtime files are still needed. Hereâ€™s how to fix it:

### Solution

#### 1. **Re-download Neovim with all the runtime files:**

If you moved only the `nvim` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`, the runtime files (which should be located in `/usr/local/share/nvim/`) are missing.

You need to move the entire Neovim folder or explicitly move the runtime files.

1. **Extract the archive again** (if necessary):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   tar -xvzf nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Move the runtime files**:
   Inside the extracted folder (likely named `nvim-macos-arm64`), you'll find a `share/nvim` directory that contains the `syntax` and other essential files.

   Move this directory to `/usr/local/share/`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/Downloads/nvim-macos-arm64/share/nvim /usr/local/share/
   ```

3. **Verify the setup**:
   After moving the runtime files, run Neovim again to see if the error is resolved:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

#### 2. **Alternatively, install Neovim using Homebrew (easier)**:
If you're running into multiple issues with manually moving files, you can install Neovim with all necessary runtime files automatically using Homebrew:
   
   1. First, remove the current manually installed version:
      ```bash
      sudo rm /usr/local/bin/nvim
      sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/nvim
      ```

   2. Install Neovim via Homebrew:
      ```bash
      brew install neovim
      ```

   3. After installation, verify the setup:
      ```bash
      nvim
      ```

Using Homebrew will ensure that everything is installed in the correct locations, and it will be easier to manage future updates.

i have neovim but it looks like is not loading nvchad

If Neovim is installed correctly but NvChad is not loading, it might be due to an issue with the installation or configuration. Here's how to troubleshoot and ensure that NvChad loads properly:

### Steps to ensure NvChad is loading:

1. **Check the NvChad installation path**:
   Make sure NvChad is installed in the correct Neovim configuration directory (`~/.config/nvim`):
   ```bash
   ls ~/.config/nvim
   ```
   You should see files like `lua/`, `init.lua`, and `chadrc.lua` inside that directory. If they aren't there, the installation may have failed.

2. **Re-clone NvChad (if necessary)**:
   If you don't see the expected NvChad files, try re-cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
   git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
   ```

3. **Check for errors when starting Neovim**:
   Run Neovim and check for errors:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   If there are any errors during startup, they should be displayed in the terminal. If it's related to missing plugins or other setup issues, we can address them accordingly.

4. **Install plugins (if they havenâ€™t been installed yet)**:
   NvChad relies on several plugins to work properly. To install the plugins, you can use NvChadâ€™s built-in plugin manager. In Neovim, run the following command:
   ```bash
   :Lazy install
   ```
   This will install all required plugins. Wait for the installation to complete, and then restart Neovim.

5. **Check Neovim version**:
   NvChad requires Neovim v0.10.0 or higher. Verify your Neovim version:
   ```bash
   nvim --version
   ```
   If your version is outdated, consider upgrading via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew upgrade neovim
   ```

6. **Check the `init.lua` file**:
   Ensure that the `init.lua` file exists in `~/.config/nvim/` and itâ€™s correctly loading NvChad:
   ```lua
   require("core")
   ```

### After following these steps:

1. Start Neovim again:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

2. If it's still not loading NvChad correctly, look for any startup messages or errors.

Let me know how it goes, and if you encounter any specific issues, share the error messages!
