# Docker: Containers, Volumes, Images.

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

how can i delete all unused containers in docker? Also explain the differences between images, volumes and containers

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To delete all unused containers in Docker, you can use the following command:

```
docker container prune
```

This command will remove all stopped containers, as well as any networks not used by at least one container, and any dangling images. You will be prompted to confirm before the command is executed.

Now, let me explain the differences between images, volumes, and containers in Docker:

1. Images: Docker images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. An image is essentially a snapshot of a Docker container, with all the necessary instructions and dependencies to create a running instance of the container. Images can be built from a Dockerfile, downloaded from a Docker registry, or exported/imported as tar files.

2. Volumes: Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are essentially directories that are outside the container's file system, and can be shared between multiple containers. Volumes are created separately from containers, and can be attached to one or more containers.

3. Containers: Docker containers are the running instances of Docker images. A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, libraries, and system tools. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, but can communicate with each other using networking and shared volumes.

In summary, Docker images are templates used to create containers, Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by containers, and Docker containers are the running instances of Docker images.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I deleted them but still having the databases in tableplus

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Deleting unused Docker containers will only remove the container instances and their associated file system data. It will not remove any data that was stored outside of the container file system, such as data that was persisted in a Docker volume or mounted host directory.

If you had a database running in a Docker container and the data was being persisted in a Docker volume, simply deleting the container will not remove the data from the volume. To remove the data, you can delete the Docker volume using the following command:

```
docker volume rm <volume-name>
```

Replace `<volume-name>` with the name of the Docker volume that was used to store the database data.

If the data was stored outside of Docker, such as on the host file system, you will need to delete the data manually. The location of the data will depend on how the container was configured and where the data was being stored.

Once you have removed the data, you should no longer see it in TablePlus or any other database management tool.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

ran docker volume prune and still see those tableplus tables

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If you ran `docker volume prune` and you still see the TablePlus tables, it's possible that the database data was not stored in a Docker volume, but rather on the host file system. 

To locate the data, you can check the Docker container configuration to see where the data was mounted. You can use the `docker inspect` command to get the details of the container, including the mounted volumes. Here's an example command:

```
docker inspect <container-name>
```

Replace `<container-name>` with the name or ID of the container that was running the database.

Look for the `"Mounts"` section in the output, which will show you the details of any mounted volumes or host directories. If you see a mount point that corresponds to the location where you're seeing the TablePlus tables, then that is where the data is stored.

Once you've located the data, you can delete it manually. Be careful not to delete any data that you still need.

Alternatively, if you no longer need the container and its associated data, you can try deleting the container and its volumes with the `docker rm -v` command. This command will remove the container and any associated volumes. However, be aware that this will permanently delete the data, so make sure you have a backup before running this command.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

the tables are in postgres, how do i delete them?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To delete tables in PostgreSQL, you can use the `DROP TABLE` command. Here's the basic syntax:

```
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to delete.

If you want to delete multiple tables at once, you can separate the table names with commas:

```
DROP TABLE table_name1, table_name2, table_name3;
```

Be careful when using the `DROP TABLE` command, as it will permanently delete the specified tables and all their data. Make sure you have a backup of your data before running this command.

If you're not sure which tables you want to delete, you can use the `\d` command in the PostgreSQL command-line interface to list all tables in the current database:

```
\d
```

This will list all tables, views, and sequences in the current database. You can also use the `\dt` command to list only the tables:

```
\dt
```

Once you've identified the tables you want to delete, you can use the `DROP TABLE` command to delete them as described above.
