In Mexico, personal possession of small quantities of marijuana (cannabis) is decriminalized under certain limits for personal use. Here are some key points you can use for your legal argument:

For your legal defense in the case of your client who was found with a joint while traveling from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City, you can rely on the following articles and subarticles from Mexican law:

### Legal References

1. **General Health Law (Ley General de Salud)**
   - **Article 479**: This article specifies the quantities of various drugs considered permissible for personal use. For cannabis, the limit is set at 5 grams. Your client, carrying less than 5 grams, falls within the legal threshold for personal use. 

2. **Supreme Court Decisions**
   - In recent years, the Mexican Supreme Court has issued several rulings that effectively decriminalize the possession of marijuana for personal use and even cultivation for personal consumption. Itâ€™s important to reference any relevant decisions as they can provide a jurisprudential basis for arguing personal use and possession rights under Mexican law.

3. **Article 237 of the National Criminal Code (CÃ³digo Penal Federal)**
   - While this article pertains to the prosecution of drug-related offenses, the thresholds in Article 479 of the General Health Law take precedence over criminal sanctions for possession under the stated limit, which should be the cornerstone of your defense.

### Suggested Legal Arguments

- **Argument of Personal Use**: Emphasize that your client possessed marijuana strictly for personal use, within the legal limits set by the General Health Law.
- **No Intent to Distribute**: Clearly state that there is no evidence suggesting intent to distribute, as the amount possessed by your client does not exceed the personal use threshold.
- **Referencing Jurisprudence**: Cite recent Supreme Court decisions that support decriminalization efforts and the rights of individuals to possess marijuana for personal use.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Discuss the possibility of pursuing an "amparo"**: This is a legal protection mechanism in Mexico used to protect citizensâ€™ constitutional rights. If your client's rights are being infringed upon, this might be a viable option.
- **Engagement with Local Authorities**: Engage diplomatically with the authorities, emphasizing respect for Mexican laws and the rights of individuals as outlined in both the General Health Law and Supreme Court decisions.

When preparing your defense, it's crucial to tailor your arguments to the specifics of the case and the current legal landscape in Mexico regarding marijuana possession. Also, ensure all legal citations are up to date and relevant to the jurisdiction where your client is being charged.
