How to search and replace :: for \n (it inserts \n instead of a new line). nvchad

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To search and replace `::` with `\n` in NVChad, which is a Neovim configuration, you would typically use a command in the Neovim command mode. However, it's important to clarify that replacing `::` with `\n` (which represents a newline character) in the text will not actually insert new lines; it will just replace `::` with the literal string `\n`.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open Neovim with NVChad Configuration**: Start Neovim with the NVChad configuration loaded.

2. **Enter Command Mode**: Press `:` to enter command mode.

3. **Execute the Search and Replace Command**:
   - To replace `::` with `\n` in the entire file, use: `:%s/::/\\n/g`
   - To replace `::` with `\n` in the current line, use: `:s/::/\\n/g`

The `%s` command in Neovim is for search and replace. `%` means the entire file, `s` is for substitute, `/::/` is what you're searching for, `/\\n/` is what you're replacing it with (note the double backslash to escape the backslash character), and `g` at the end is for 'global', which means all occurrences in the line or file.

Remember, this will replace `::` with the characters `\n`, not with actual new lines. If you want to insert actual new lines, that's a bit more complex and might require a different approach, possibly involving scripting within Neovim.

If you want to replace `::` with an actual newline in NVChad (a configuration for Neovim), you can use a slightly different command in Neovim. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open Neovim with NVChad Configuration**: Launch Neovim where you have NVChad installed.

2. **Enter Command Mode**: Press `:` to enter the command mode.

3. **Execute the Search and Replace Command**:
   - To replace `::` with a new line in the entire file, use: `:%s/::/\r/g`
   - To replace `::` with a new line in the current line, use: `:s/::/\r/g`

In this command, `%s` tells Neovim to search and replace across the entire file. `::` is the pattern you are searching for, `\r` is the carriage return character, which in the context of Neovim's substitute command will insert a new line, and `g` stands for 'global', meaning it will replace every occurrence in the line or file.

Make sure to test this on a non-critical file first to ensure it behaves as expected, as the behavior might vary slightly based on specific configurations or versions of Neovim and NVChad.
