Designing a targeted marketing campaign involves understanding your target audience and leveraging various platforms and techniques to reach them. Given that you've identified followers of TheNewCenter and those interested in specific books about Critical Theory, here's a tailored marketing strategy for you:

**1. Audience Profiling:**
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, occupation.
- **Psychographics**: Interests in politics, philosophy, critical theory, specific books/authors.
- **Behavioral**: How they consume content (online blogs, forums, e-books, physical books), purchase patterns.

**2. Content Creation:**
- Write blog posts or articles that delve into topics related to your book and the books you mentioned. These articles can be teasers, excerpts, or discussions that might interest your target audience.
- Create visually appealing graphics, quotes, and snippets from your book to share on social media platforms.
- Record short video clips or podcasts discussing the themes of your book.

**3. Leverage Social Media Platforms:**
- **Twitter**: Given the intellectual nature of your target, Twitter might be a great place. Use relevant hashtags like #TheNewCenter, #CriticalTheory, #altwoke, etc. Engage with thought leaders in the space.
- **Reddit**: Subreddits like r/philosophy, r/CriticalTheory, or other related niches can be valuable. Consider doing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session.
- **Instagram**: If your content is visually appealing, use this platform, especially for book quotes and snippets.
- **LinkedIn**: Share articles that cater to academic or intellectual professionals.
  
**4. Direct Outreach:**
- Identify influential figures or bloggers in the space and send them a copy of your book for review or discussion.
- Collaborate with podcasts or YouTube channels in the related niche for interviews or discussions.

- Consider Google Ads targeting specific search terms related to the books or topics of interest.

**6. Retargeting:**
- Use Pixel tracking on your website or landing page. Retarget visitors with ads, reminding them about your book or offering special discounts.

**7. Email Marketing:**
- If you have a website or blog, set up an email subscription form. Send newsletters, updates, and special offers related to your book.
  
**8. SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**
- Ensure your website or blog is optimized for search terms related to Critical Theory or the specific books you mentioned. This way, organic search can drive traffic.

**9. Collaborate with Book Platforms:**
- Platforms like Goodreads allow for book giveaways and advertising. Consider leveraging these to get in front of avid readers.

**10. Local Outreach:**
