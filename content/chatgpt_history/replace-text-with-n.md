# Replace Text with \n

## âœ… TODOs
- [ ] with Vim's internal handling of newline and carriage return characters, which stems from its lineage and compatibility with older text processing conventions. In ASCII, newline (`LF` or line feed) is represented as 0x0A (10 in decimal), and carriage return (`CR`) as 0x0D (13 in decimal). When editing files in Unix or Linux systems that use `LF` for line breaks, any `CR` characters (`\r`) you see are displayed as `^M` in Vim.

Like:
:%s/text/JUMPSPACE

To replace all occurrences of a specific text with a newline character in Vim, you need to use Vim's substitution command, but with a little twist because Vim treats the newline character in a special way. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your file in Vim.
2. Enter the following command:

   ```
   :%s/text/\r/g
   ```

   In this command:
   - `%` means to search in the whole file.
   - `s` is for substitution.
   - `text` is the text you want to replace.
   - `\r` is the representation of a newline in Vim's substitution command.
   - `g` at the end is to ensure all occurrences in a line are replaced (global replacement).

If you literally want to replace `text` with the word `JUMPSPACE`, followed by a newline, you would use:

```
:%s/text/JUMPSPACE\r/g
```

This will replace every instance of `text` with `JUMPSPACE` followed by a newline. Remember to be careful with global replacements in Vim, as they can change your entire file very quickly!

In Vim, the substitution of characters with newline characters can be a bit tricky because of the way Vim interprets newline and carriage return characters. The `\n` character in Vim's search pattern matches the end of a line, but in the replacement string, it is interpreted as a null byte. On the other hand, `\r` in the replacement part of a Vim substitution command is translated to a newline character in the resulting text.

When you use `:%s/text/\r/g` in Vim, the command is essentially searching for `text` and replacing it with a newline character across the entire file (`%` denotes the whole file, `s` is for substitution, and `g` is for global replacement). 

This behavior has to do with Vim's internal handling of newline and carriage return characters, which stems from its lineage and compatibility with older text processing conventions. In ASCII, newline (`LF` or line feed) is represented as 0x0A (10 in decimal), and carriage return (`CR`) as 0x0D (13 in decimal). When editing files in Unix or Linux systems that use `LF` for line breaks, any `CR` characters (`\r`) you see are displayed as `^M` in Vim.
