ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Let's explore these ventures in the context of your interests and past experiences:

1. **L Catterton Growth**: This growth equity firm focuses on consumer brands, which aligns with your background in Fashion Business at Parsons and running *HiBye* in CDMX for five years. L Catterton's expertise in scaling consumer-facing companies could resonate with your past retail experience and your exploration of art, design, and contemporary business trends.

2. **Emerson Collective**: Founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, Emerson Collective is a social change organization focused on education, immigration reform, and environmental justice. This could tie in with your political activism and social critique, as reflected in your book *Plantar Cara La Partida*, which challenges systemic issues like capitalism and advocates for radical change.

3. **Notable Capital**: Although a smaller, early-stage investment firm, Notable Capital has a focus on tech startups. Your interest in building Rails apps, automating blog platforms, and exploring MVPs with strong product-market fit could connect with the type of tech companies Notable supports.

4. **Bain Capital Ventures**: Bain's focus on tech, media, and SaaS companies overlaps with your ventures in software development, especially your projects around creating digital gardens and Jekyll-based blogs. Bain's investment approach toward scaling SaaS could offer useful insights as you develop subscription-based business models through Stripe for your online projects.

5. **Khosla Ventures**: Known for its bold investments in breakthrough technologies, Khosla focuses on impactful sectors such as AI and healthcare. Given your growing interests in data science (Andrew Ngâ€™s course) and technical innovations like integrating Salesforce into Rails, Khoslaâ€™s future-focused mindset might inspire your own ventures that aim to address power asymmetries in land, labor, and capital.

6. **Baseline Ventures**: This venture capital firm supports early-stage startups, often in the software and internet space. Your expertise in web development, Rails apps, and online businesses aligns well with Baselineâ€™s focus on high-potential tech startups.

7. **Cowboy Ventures**: Founded by Aileen Lee, Cowboy Ventures is known for backing tech-driven startups. Their support for mission-driven founders could appeal to your interest in radical social structures and organizational innovation, such as the political voting system youâ€™re developing.

8. **Bedrock Capital**: Bedrock takes a contrarian approach to venture investing, often backing unconventional ideas. This approach might resonate with your non-traditional projects, like automating Jekyll-digital-garden platforms and building a business around impactful, socially conscious business models.

9. **PLUS Capital**: PLUS Capital helps creative individuals and influencers build businesses. While not directly tied to your tech projects, their role in branding and scaling creative-driven ventures could be relevant as you expand your personal brand, considering your past in retail and interest in art and design.

These ventures could intersect with your goals for innovation in technology, business, and politics, especially in areas where you seek to combine your Rails development skills with radical social change or artistic business models.
