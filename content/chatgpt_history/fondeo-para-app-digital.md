Here are several funding opportunities relevant to your Rails app project for publishing Obsidian-based digital gardens:

1. **FONDESO (Fondo para el Desarrollo Social de la CDMX)** offers up to **500,000 MXN** with a **6% annual interest rate** for startups or entrepreneurs based in Mexico City. Their focus is on supporting small and medium enterprises and fostering economic recovery. The funding includes a mandatory training component to increase the success rate of funded projects【9†source】.

2. **Programa de Apoyos y Financiamientos (2024)** provides up to **1,000,000 MXN** in loans for startups in Mexico, aimed at improving liquidity and capital for businesses. Their terms include a **12.5% interest rate** with a flexible 4-year repayment period【8†source】.

3. **500 Global**, a well-known investment fund for startups, is offering **$300,000 USD** in exchange for **10% equity** for Latin American startups. This funding comes with personalized business support for up to 12 months, allowing companies to consolidate their business models and achieve product-market fit. Applications are evaluated on a rolling basis【12†source】.

4. **Fondo Semillas** is specifically geared toward projects led by women, trans, or intersex individuals. If your project aligns with feminist values or social justice goals, this could be a suitable funding option, though it focuses on non-profit groups【10†source】.
