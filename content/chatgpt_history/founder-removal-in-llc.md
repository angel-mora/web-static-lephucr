ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

No, you donâ€™t necessarily need to close the company. Removing a founder who has dropped out can be handled by amending the operating agreement and updating the cap table. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on what you can do:

---

### 1. **Check the Operating Agreement**
   Since youâ€™re using an LLC structure, the operating agreement governs the ownership and rights of members (i.e., founders). The agreement should outline the process for removing or replacing members. Look for sections related to:
   - Resignation or withdrawal of a member
   - Amendment of membership interests

---

### 2. **Negotiate the Exit**
   Even if the founder has dropped out informally, you need a formal agreement to reflect that they are no longer involved. This usually involves:
   - **Waiver of membership interest**: The founder can sign a document waiving any claim to their ownership or future equity.
   - **Repurchase or forfeiture of membership interest**: If they have received any equity (units), you can buy back their interest, or they can forfeit it if no consideration was given.

---

### 3. **Amend the Cap Table**
   If they have already been issued units or equity, update the cap table by removing their allocation. This ensures future equity distributions and stock plans are accurate.

---

### 4. **Update Clerky**
   Contacting Clerky support is a good idea since youâ€™re in the early stages of setup. They may guide you through:
   - Amending your operating agreement to reflect the removal
   - Ensuring the pending stock plan adoption doesnâ€™t include the former founder
   - Removing the founderâ€™s information from relevant documents

---

### 5. **Amend Formation Documents (If Necessary)**
   If the dropped-out founder was listed in the initial formation documents (e.g., Articles of Organization filed with the state), you might need to file an amendment with the Secretary of State to update the official records.

---

### 6. **Proceed with Post-Incorporation Setup**
   Once the founder has been formally removed and the necessary amendments are made, you can proceed with:
   - Stock plan adoption (without the former founder)
   - Other post-incorporation steps like setting up a bank account and EIN

---

### Key Points to Clarify with Clerky Support:
   - Whether they can help with the amendment or recommend an attorney if needed
   - How to handle pending tasks (like the stock plan) in light of this change
   - Whether any fees are involved in amending your documents through Clerky
