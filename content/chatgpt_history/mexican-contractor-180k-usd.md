ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Reaching a salary of $180K/year as a Mexican contractor focusing on Rails development and with a CompTIA Security+ certification is ambitious but achievable. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for you:

1. **Build a Strong Portfolio**: Showcase your best work. If you've developed any Rails applications, even if they are personal projects, document them and make them available on platforms like GitHub.

2. **Continuous Learning**: The tech world evolves quickly. Stay updated on the latest Rails trends, libraries, and best practices. Also, consider learning complimentary tech stacks and tools that are in demand (e.g., React, Vue.js, AWS).

3. **Networking**: Engage with professionals in the industry:
    - Attend Rails or tech conferences (even if they're virtual).
    - Join online communities such as Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/rails, or Discord servers related to Rails and tech.
    - Engage on LinkedIn with recruiters and Rails professionals in the U.S.

4. **Security Niche**: With your CompTIA Security+ certification, consider specializing in Rails applications with a focus on security. There's a demand for developers who can build and maintain secure web applications. 

5. **Freelance Platforms**: Websites like Upwork, Toptal, and Freelancer can be used to build a US-based clientele. Initially, you might have to take lower-paying jobs to build a reputation, but over time you can demand higher rates.

6. **Target High-Paying Industries**: Some sectors like finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity generally have higher budgets for tech. If you can specialize in Rails development for one of these sectors, you'll be in a better position to command higher rates.

7. **Research Companies**: Many U.S. companies are open to hiring foreign contractors, especially in the tech sector. Companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and many startups look for talented Rails developers. Look for roles like "Senior Rails Developer", "Rails Security Specialist", or "Backend Engineer".

8. **Improve Soft Skills**: Good communication is key, especially if you're working remotely. Improve your English proficiency, presentation skills, and the ability to work effectively in teams.

9. **Negotiate**: When discussing contracts or roles, don't be shy about your salary expectations. Be transparent about your experience, skills, and what you bring to the table. Research market rates for Rails developers with your skill set in the U.S. to back up your demands.

10. **Legal and Tax Implications**: If you're contracting for U.S. companies from Mexico, you'll need to understand the legal and tax implications. This might involve setting up a business entity or working through a third-party payroll company.

To summarize, while $180K/year is a high target, with specialization, continuous learning, networking, and targeting the right industries and companies, it's achievable. Remember, it's not just about technical skills; your ability to communicate, understand the client's needs, and deliver on time are just as crucial.
