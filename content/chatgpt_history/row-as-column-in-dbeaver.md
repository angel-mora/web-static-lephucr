How can I see a row like in tableplus as a column but in dbeaver?



In **DBeaver**, you can view a row as a column-like structure (similar to TablePlus) by using the **Record view** feature. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to View a Row as Columns in DBeaver:
1. **Open the Table or Query Results**:
   - Navigate to your table or run a query to display the result set in the data viewer.

2. **Select a Row**:
   - Click on the row you want to view in detail.

3. **Enable Record View**:
   - Locate the **Record view** panel at the bottom of the results pane. If it's not visible:
     - Right-click anywhere in the data grid.
     - Choose **View/Record** or press **F7** (default shortcut).
   - Alternatively, click the **Record view** button in the toolbar above the data grid.

4. **View the Row Details**:
   - The selected row's data will now appear in a vertical format, with column names as labels and their corresponding values displayed below them.

### Additional Tips:
- **Synchronize Selection**: When you select a different row in the grid, the **Record view** will update automatically to display the selected row's details.
- **Edit Data**: You can directly edit values in the **Record view**, similar to inline editing in the grid.
- **Customize Layout**: You can resize the **Record view** panel or move it to a more convenient position by dragging it within the DBeaver interface.

This feature is particularly helpful for viewing and editing rows with many columns or when you want to see the data in a more readable, column-like structure.
