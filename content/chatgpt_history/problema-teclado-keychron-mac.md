ðŸ™‹ **You:**

CMD fn1 backtick in a keychron A language keyboard does not switch between different windows of same applications but using regular LA keyboard does.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

It sounds like you're facing an issue with the Keychron keyboard's key mapping or functionality on a Mac with the Spanish layout (LA). The combination of `Cmd` + `Fn1` (or backtick) should switch between different windows of the same application, but it's not working as expected with the Keychron keyboard.

Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. **Check Keyboard Layout Settings:**
   - Go to `System Settings` > `Keyboard` > `Input Sources` and ensure the correct language/keyboard layout (Latin American or Spanish) is selected. Add a new layout if necessary to test switching between them.

2. **Modify Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Go to `System Settings` > `Keyboard` > `Shortcuts` > `App Shortcuts`.
   - Look for the shortcut to switch between windows (normally `Cmd + `), and try reassigning it to see if the Keychron registers the combination properly.

3. **Test Without Fn Key:**
   - Try pressing just `Cmd + ` (without `Fn1`) to see if it works. Keychron keyboards may interpret function keys differently, depending on the mode they're set to. 

4. **Switch Keychron Modes:**
   - Keychron keyboards usually have a switch or combination of keys (like `Fn + X` or `Fn + Y`) to toggle between different modes (Mac, Windows, etc.). Make sure it's set to the Mac mode.

5. **Key Remapping Tools:**
   - If the issue persists, you can use a tool like **Karabiner-Elements** to remap the backtick or function keys for your Keychron keyboard and make sure they perform the desired action.

6. **Check Fn Lock:**
   - Some Keychron models have an "Fn Lock" feature that might be causing the function keys to behave differently. Toggle this lock by pressing `Fn + Esc` and then try using the shortcut again.

Try these suggestions, and let me know if any of them resolve the issue!
