# Pattern Match in nvchad

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

In nvchad I want to 
:%s/expect(/is_expected.
but I want it to pattern match all content inside the expect, like:
:%s/expect(*)/is_expected.
How do I achieve this?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To perform a pattern match for content inside the `expect(` in nvchad, you can use regular expressions with Vim's search and replace (`:s`) command. Here's how you can achieve this:

```vim
:%s/expect(\([^)]*\))/is_expected\1/g
```

Let's break down the components of the regular expression:

- `expect(`: This part matches the literal string "expect(".
- `\(`: This starts a capturing group.
- `[^)]*`: This matches any characters except a closing parenthesis `)`. This allows you to match everything inside the `expect(` until the closing parenthesis.
- `\)`: This ends the capturing group.
- `/`: This is the delimiter that separates the search pattern and the replacement.
- `is_expected`: This is the replacement string.
- `\1`: This refers to the content captured by the first capturing group (i.e., everything inside the `expect(` and `)`).
- `/g`: This flag at the end stands for global, meaning it will replace all occurrences on a line, not just the first.

So, the whole command replaces `expect(...)` with `is_expected...` while preserving the content inside the parentheses.
