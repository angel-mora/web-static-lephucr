In RubyMine, you can use the **"Search Everywhere"** feature to quickly search for items, including database tables, files, or symbols. Here's how to achieve a similar experience to CMD + P in TablePlus:

### Steps in RubyMine:
1. **Invoke "Search Everywhere"**:
   - Press `Shift` twice (double-tap Shift quickly).
   - This opens the "Search Everywhere" dialog.

2. **Search for Database Tables**:
   - Start typing the name of the table you're looking for.
   - If you've already set up your database in RubyMine, it will show relevant results, including database tables, files, and symbols.

3. **Filter Results (Optional)**:
   - Use the small icons at the top of the "Search Everywhere" dialog to filter by **Database**, **Files**, or other categories if too many results appear.

### Database View in RubyMine:
If you haven't set up your database in RubyMine yet:
1. Go to the **Database** tool window (`Cmd + 1` to open it from the sidebar, or `View > Tool Windows > Database`).
2. Configure your database connection by clicking the **"+" icon** and selecting your database type (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
3. After connecting, your database tables will be visible in the **Database tool window**. You can then use the search feature to look for specific tables.

Once set up, the database integration in RubyMine can provide table search functionality similar to TablePlus.
