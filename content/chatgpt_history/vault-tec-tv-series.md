Fallout show about Voltec



The "Fallout" TV series, based on the popular post-apocalyptic video game franchise by Bethesda, is set to explore the world of Vault-Tec and its vaults. Vault-Tec is a key element in the Fallout universe, known for creating underground bunkers (vaults) designed to protect humanity from nuclear fallout. However, these vaults often had hidden, unethical experiments conducted on their inhabitants.

The show aims to delve into the rich lore and intricate stories surrounding these vaults, providing fans with a deeper understanding of Vault-Tec's role and the various vault dwellers' experiences. It is expected to feature the blend of dark humor, retro-futuristic aesthetics, and complex moral dilemmas that the games are known for.

Produced by Amazon Studios, the series is being developed by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, creators of the acclaimed series "Westworld." The Fallout TV series promises to bring the iconic elements of the games to life, while expanding on the narrative with new characters and storylines.
