   - Questions to consider:
     - Who are they? (Demographics)
     - What do they do? (Behavior)
     - What problem are they facing? (Pain Points)

     - Monitor metrics like location, user flow, bounce rate, session duration, and demographics.
   - **Mixpanel** or **Amplitude**  
     - Track product usage and user behavior.
     - Great for SaaS or apps to analyze retention, cohort analysis, and user funnels.

#### **Social Media Analytics**
   - Platforms like **Facebook Insights**, **Twitter Analytics**, and **Instagram Insights** offer valuable audience data.
