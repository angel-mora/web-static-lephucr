# AI Thesis Audience Analysis

## üß† Full Chat

üôã **You:**

How can I use AI existing tools to train a model into my academic thesis so it helps me understand who my research is assuming as audience and questions (like in scorecard app) to understand my audience based on my key research points? I've heard about graph llm models but I am a total newbie in the field

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

User is interested in using AI tools to analyze their academic thesis to understand the assumed audience and key research questions, and has heard of graph LLM models but is a newbie in the field.

---

**Tool:**

Model set context updated.

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

To use AI tools for analyzing your thesis, here‚Äôs a roadmap you can follow to understand your assumed audience and research questions:

### 1. **Extract Key Points from Your Thesis**
   - Use tools like **OpenAI GPT**, **ChatGPT**, or **Claude** to summarize chapters or sections of your thesis. Input your thesis text and prompt the model to extract:
     - Key arguments.
     - Assumptions about the audience.
     - Central research questions.

### 2. **Map Research Themes with Topic Modeling**
   - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: This is a popular technique for topic modeling. Libraries like Python‚Äôs `gensim` can identify the main topics in your thesis.
   - **Graph-based Analysis**: Tools like **Neo4j** combined with embeddings from a large language model (LLM) can help create a graph of interconnected themes.

### 3. **Audience Assumption Analysis**
   - Prompt LLMs with specific questions like:
     - "Who would benefit from understanding this research?"
     - "What level of knowledge does the text assume the reader has?"
   - Use outputs to reflect on the language and assumed prior knowledge.

### 4. **Incorporate a Scorecard Approach**
   - Train a lightweight model or use a custom script to classify thesis sentences into categories like:
     - Audience appeals (technical, generalist, interdisciplinary).
     - Clarity of research questions.
   - You can automate this using open-source tools like Hugging Face models (e.g., `distilbert`) for text classification.

### 5. **Visualize Relationships**
   - Tools like **Gephi** or **D3.js** can visualize concepts extracted from your thesis, revealing clusters and relationships between your audience assumptions and research points.

### 6. **Leverage Graph LLM Models**
   - If you‚Äôre exploring graph LLMs, look into:
     - **Neo4j Graph Data Science Library**: To analyze structured relationships in your thesis.
     - **LangChain**: For combining LLMs with graph databases.
   - Graph-based models can organize the connections between key topics, assumptions, and potential audiences.

### 7. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Run small experiments with tools like **ChatGPT Code Interpreter**, Python‚Äôs `spaCy`, or `NLTK` for natural language processing.
   - Seek feedback from peers or advisors on the insights generated.

Would you like detailed examples of how to implement any of these steps? Or perhaps guidance on a specific tool like Neo4j or LangChain?

üôã **You:**

But my trained model will be able to answer specific details? Like, page where a reference I'm talking about is. Or will it remember in a determinist way a list of items from one chapter?

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

To achieve a trained model capable of answering specific details such as the page where a reference is mentioned or deterministically remembering a list of items, you need to combine several techniques and tools. Here‚Äôs how it works and what you can expect:

---

### **1. Specific Details (e.g., Page Numbers)**
For tasks like finding where a reference is located:
- **Document Indexing**: Use a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus) to store embeddings of each paragraph or section of your thesis along with metadata, such as page numbers.
  - **Workflow**:
    - Break your thesis into chunks (e.g., paragraphs, sections).
    - Create embeddings for each chunk using a pretrained LLM (like OpenAI‚Äôs Ada embedding model).
    - Store embeddings in the vector database along with metadata (e.g., page numbers).
    - When querying, the database retrieves the relevant chunks and their metadata.
  - This ensures that queries return the specific page or section you're referencing.

---

### **2. Deterministic Memory for Lists**
For tasks like consistently recalling a list of items from a chapter:
- **Explicit Data Structures**: Use relational databases or JSON files to store structured lists extracted from your thesis.
  - Example:
    - Extract a table of contents or lists into a structured format.
    - Query the data directly for a deterministic response.
- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Fine-tune an open-source LLM (e.g., GPT-J, LLaMA) on your thesis to improve recall of specific data, but this can be less deterministic unless paired with structured storage.

---

### **3. Combining Tools for Reliable Answers**
- **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
  - Pair an LLM with a knowledge base (e.g., embeddings + database).
  - When you ask a question, the LLM retrieves data from the knowledge base to ensure accurate responses.
  - Tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex can facilitate this workflow.

- **Deterministic Behavior**:
  - Use LLMs for natural language interpretation.
  - Rely on your indexed or structured storage for factual consistency.
  - This ensures your model doesn‚Äôt "hallucinate" (generate incorrect or fabricated details).

---

### **4. Expected Behavior**
- **Yes**, with proper setup:
  - Your model can answer questions like "Which page discusses [topic]?" deterministically.
  - It can recall lists and specific details from chapters consistently.
- **No**, if you solely fine-tune an LLM:
  - Fine-tuned models are probabilistic and may not reliably output specific details like page numbers or structured lists.

---

### **Tools and Technologies**
- **Vector Database**:
  - Use Pinecone or Weaviate to retrieve specific chunks by semantic similarity.
- **Structured Data**:
  - Use SQLite or a CSV/JSON to store structured lists or metadata.
- **LLM Frameworks**:
  - **LangChain**: To integrate LLMs with your indexed data for reliable Q&A.
  - **LlamaIndex**: To transform your thesis into a searchable knowledge graph.

üôã **You:**

Summarize a roadmap for an mvp, preferably using pre-existing tools so by just being a developer I will be able to implement them without understanding a lot of data science. Decide the best approach considering time and complexity caveats

---

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

Here‚Äôs a simplified roadmap for building an MVP that uses AI tools to analyze your academic thesis and answer specific questions (like identifying assumed audience or pinpointing reference locations). The goal is to use pre-existing tools and frameworks, minimizing complexity and time investment:

---

### **Roadmap:**

#### **Step 1: Document Preparation**
1. **Split Your Thesis into Chunks**:
   - Divide your thesis into manageable sections (paragraphs or pages).
   - Include metadata (e.g., page numbers, chapter titles).
   - Tool: Use Python‚Äôs `PyPDF2` or `pandas` to extract and organize text into a CSV or JSON.

2. **Create Embeddings for Each Chunk**:
   - Use a pre-trained model like OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-ada-002` or Hugging Face models.
   - Store the embedding vectors with their metadata (e.g., page numbers, section names).
   - Tool: LangChain or Hugging Face libraries.

---

#### **Step 2: Set Up a Vector Database**
1. **Choose a Vector Database**:
   - Use Pinecone (easy to set up, managed), Weaviate, or a local SQLite solution if needed.
   - Store embeddings and metadata.

2. **Integrate the Database**:
   - Use Python with `pinecone` or `weaviate-client` libraries.
   - Ensure queries retrieve relevant sections when asked specific questions.

---

#### **Step 3: Build the Query Interface**
1. **Integrate a Pre-Trained LLM**:
   - Use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 API or Hugging Face‚Äôs pre-trained LLMs for answering questions.
   - Example workflow:
     - Input: User asks a question (e.g., ‚ÄúWhere is the reference to [X]?‚Äù).
     - Step 1: Retrieve related chunks using the vector database.
     - Step 2: Pass retrieved chunks to the LLM for final output generation.

2. **Set Up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Tool: LangChain provides a simple framework to combine vector search with LLMs.

---

#### **Step 4: Develop a Web Interface (Optional)**
1. **Simple Frontend**:
   - Use Streamlit (Python-based and quick to set up) for a basic web interface.
   - Features:
     - Upload thesis (PDF).
     - Ask questions via a text box.
     - Display results.

2. **Backend API**:
   - Use Flask or FastAPI to build an API for question-answering if you need flexibility for custom interfaces.

---

#### **Step 5: Test and Refine**
1. **Test Queries**:
   - Try questions about the audience and references to evaluate accuracy.
   - Refine prompts or chunk size if answers are imprecise.

2. **Optimize for Specific Use Cases**:
   - If needed, fine-tune the LLM or improve vector search parameters for your dataset.

---

### **Time and Complexity Caveats**
- **Complexity**: The hardest part is setting up the vector database and integrating embeddings with the LLM. Tools like LangChain simplify this.
- **Time**:
  - Document preprocessing: ~1-2 hours.
  - Embedding creation: ~1-3 hours (depends on document size and API speed).
  - Database setup and integration: ~2-4 hours.
  - Frontend/Backend: ~4-6 hours for basic functionality.

---

### **Recommended Approach**
- **Use LangChain with Pinecone and OpenAI**:
   - Simplifies database integration and retrieval-augmented LLMs.
   - Scales easily for additional features.
- **Frontend**: Start with Streamlit for a simple MVP interface.
