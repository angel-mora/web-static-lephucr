Logitech ergo keyboard, how can I type an at symbol? Press shift + 2 and shows double quotes despite having the at and the quotes in the 2 number



It sounds like your keyboard layout is set to a different region than you expect. This issue commonly occurs when the layout is set to something other than your intended one, such as a US layout vs. a UK or other regional layout.

To resolve this, follow these steps depending on your operating system:

### **For Windows:**
1. **Open Settings**: Press `Windows Key + I` or go to the Start menu and click Settings.
2. **Go to Time & Language**: Click on ‚ÄúTime & Language,‚Äù then select ‚ÄúLanguage‚Äù from the sidebar.
3. **Check Keyboard Layout**: Under the "Preferred languages" section, select your language (e.g., English), then click ‚ÄúOptions.‚Äù
4. **Add or Adjust the Keyboard Layout**: Under "Keyboards," ensure that the correct layout (e.g., US QWERTY) is selected. You can add a new layout if needed by clicking "Add a keyboard."
5. **Switch Between Layouts**: If multiple layouts are installed, press `Windows Key + Space` to switch between them until the correct one is selected.

### **For macOS:**
1. **Open System Preferences**: Click on the Apple menu and go to ‚ÄúSystem Preferences.‚Äù
2. **Select Keyboard**: Go to the ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù option.
3. **Input Sources**: Click on the ‚ÄúInput Sources‚Äù tab. Make sure the correct keyboard layout is selected (e.g., "U.S.").
4. **Add New Layout**: If it‚Äôs incorrect, click the "+" icon to add the correct layout and remove the incorrect one.

### **For Linux (Ubuntu example):**
1. **Open Settings**: Go to the settings panel.
2. **Keyboard**: Find the ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù settings.
3. **Layout**: Make sure the correct keyboard layout is set. If not, add the proper one (e.g., US QWERTY) and remove any others.

Once you ensure your layout matches your physical keyboard, pressing `Shift + 2` should type the "@" symbol as expected.

I have mac and both are set in spanish

User has a Mac, and their keyboard layout is set in Spanish.

Model set context updated.

Since your Mac is set to a Spanish keyboard layout, you‚Äôll need to use the following key combination to type the "@" symbol:

1. **Press `Option (Alt)` + `2`**: This should type the "@" symbol on a Spanish keyboard layout.

Let me know if this works!

option also shows the double quoutes



It sounds like the keyboard layout may still not be aligned with what you're expecting, even though it's set to Spanish. Here‚Äôs a workaround specific to a Spanish (ISO) keyboard layout:

To type the "@" symbol on a Spanish keyboard layout, try the following:

1. **Press `Alt` (Option) + `G`**.

This is the correct combination for typing the "@" symbol on a Spanish Mac keyboard layout. Let me know if this works!

it shows ¬© instead, how can I set it up again?

It seems like the keyboard layout might not be set correctly even though it says "Spanish." Let's walk through how to reset and ensure the correct layout is chosen on your Mac.

### Steps to reset the keyboard layout:

1. **Go to System Preferences**:
   - Click on the Apple logo at the top left corner of your screen and select "System Preferences."

2. **Go to Keyboard Settings**:
   - In System Preferences, click on ‚ÄúKeyboard.‚Äù

3. **Go to Input Sources**:
   - In the Keyboard settings window, go to the "Input Sources" tab.
   
4. **Ensure the Correct Layout**:
   - Make sure you have "Spanish - ISO" selected. If not, follow these steps:
     1. Click the "+" icon at the bottom left of the input sources list.
     2. In the search box, type "Spanish."
     3. Select "Spanish - ISO" and click "Add."
     4. Remove any other layouts by selecting them and pressing the "‚àí" button.

5. **Activate the Input Source Menu**:
   - Make sure the "Show input menu in menu bar" box is checked. This will display the current keyboard layout in the top-right corner of your menu bar. 

6. **Test the Layout**:
   - Now try typing the "@" symbol again by pressing `Shift` + `2`. On the Spanish (ISO) layout, this should type the "@" symbol.

If this still doesn‚Äôt work, you might want to double-check that no other system settings or third-party apps are interfering with the keyboard layout. Let me know if it helps!

no luck, that at is the only one not working as expected. Isn't there another combination?

If everything else on the Spanish (ISO) keyboard is working correctly except for the "@" symbol, here's an alternative combination you can try that is often used on Spanish keyboards:

### Alternative combination for the "@" symbol:
1. **Press `Shift` + `Alt (Option)` + `2`**.

This combination should work for typing the "@" symbol on Spanish (ISO) keyboards, especially when the usual combinations don‚Äôt work as expected.

Let me know if this combination works for you!

still no luck, can I see the keyboard visually?

You can visualize the current keyboard layout on macOS using the **Keyboard Viewer**. Here's how to open it and check the correct key combination for the "@" symbol:

### Steps to show the Keyboard Viewer:

1. **Go to System Preferences**:
   - Click on the Apple logo at the top left corner of your screen and select "System Preferences."

2. **Go to Keyboard Settings**:
   - In System Preferences, click on ‚ÄúKeyboard.‚Äù

3. **Enable Keyboard Viewer**:
   - In the "Keyboard" tab, make sure to check the box that says **"Show Keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar"**.

4. **Open the Keyboard Viewer**:
   - Now, in your menu bar at the top right of the screen, you should see an icon that looks like a flag (representing your current language).
   - Click on that flag icon and select **"Show Keyboard Viewer"**.

5. **Check the Layout**:
   - The Keyboard Viewer will show a virtual keyboard that mirrors your actual keyboard layout.
   - Press and hold the `Shift` key to see what symbols are available with `Shift`.
   - Press and hold the `Option (Alt)` key to see what symbols are available with `Option (Alt)`.

6. **Find the "@" Symbol**:
   - Experiment with combinations like `Shift`, `Option (Alt)`, and `Shift + Option` while watching the Keyboard Viewer to find the correct key for the "@" symbol.

This should give you a visual guide to identify which key combination produces the "@" symbol on your specific layout. Let me know what you find!

@ it seems it's alt + q, which is weird cause the keyboard shows the at in the 2. Is it possible it's not latam but spain?

Yes, that sounds like the keyboard layout might be set to the **Spanish (Spain)** layout instead of **Spanish (Latin America)**. In the Spanish (Spain) layout, `Alt + Q` is indeed the correct combination for typing the "@" symbol, while the label on the `2` key can be misleading.

Here‚Äôs how you can check and switch to the **Spanish (Latin America)** layout, which might align more with what you‚Äôre expecting:

### Steps to switch to Spanish (Latin America) layout:

1. **Go to System Preferences**:
   - Click the Apple logo at the top left of your screen and choose "System Preferences."

2. **Open Keyboard Settings**:
   - Click on ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù in the System Preferences.

3. **Go to Input Sources**:
   - In the ‚ÄúInput Sources‚Äù tab, you'll see the currently selected keyboard layout.
   
4. **Add the Spanish (Latin America) Layout**:
   - Click the "+" button at the bottom left.
   - In the search bar, type ‚ÄúSpanish.‚Äù
   - Select **"Spanish (Latin America)"** from the list.
   - Click "Add."

5. **Remove the Spanish (Spain) Layout** (if it's listed):
   - If you see "Spanish" or "Spanish (Spain)" in the input sources list, select it and click the "‚àí" button to remove it.

6. **Switch to Spanish (Latin America)**:
   - You can confirm the new layout by checking the flag icon in your menu bar or using `Command + Space` to switch between input methods.

Once you switch to **Spanish (Latin America)**, `Shift + 2` should work as expected for the "@" symbol.

So it works now

Great to hear that it works now! Switching to the **Spanish (Latin America)** layout solved the issue. If you need any more assistance or run into other questions, feel free to reach out!

So it works now using alt + q. Now I want to do the @ in my ergo logitech keyboard inside a Ubuntu VM from aws workspace (in my mac) but the alt q doesnt work inside it. Please provide a solution

User uses an Ubuntu VM inside AWS Workspace on their Mac.

Model set context updated.

For your Ubuntu VM inside AWS Workspace on a Mac, the `Alt + Q` combination might not work due to the way the VM handles the keyboard input. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

### 1. Check the Keyboard Layout in the Ubuntu VM:
Your Ubuntu VM might not be using the correct keyboard layout. Follow these steps to make sure it's set to the right layout.

#### Steps to check and set the keyboard layout:
1. **Open Settings**:
   - On your Ubuntu VM, open the **Settings** application from the main menu.

2. **Go to Region & Language**:
   - In the settings window, go to **Region & Language**.

3. **Check the Input Sources**:
   - Under "Input Sources," ensure the keyboard layout is set to **Spanish (Latin America)** or **Spanish (ISO)**, depending on the layout you are using on your Mac.
   - If it‚Äôs not, click the "+" button to add the correct layout. Choose "Spanish (Latin America)" from the list.

4. **Remove Other Layouts**:
   - If other layouts are enabled (like English or Spanish - Spain), remove them to avoid conflicts.

5. **Test the "@" symbol**:
   - Once set, try typing `Alt + Q` again or `Shift + 2` if your new layout uses that combination for the "@" symbol.

### 2. Try "On-Screen Keyboard" in Ubuntu:
If the layout is correct but the combination still doesn‚Äôt work, you can use the on-screen keyboard to confirm the right key combination.

#### Steps to enable On-Screen Keyboard:
1. **Open Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Universal Access** > **Typing**.
   
2. **Enable On-Screen Keyboard**:
   - Toggle the **On-Screen Keyboard** on. You can then use it to find the correct key for typing the "@" symbol and test different combinations.

### 3. Using xev to Identify Key Codes:
If none of the above works, you can use the `xev` tool to identify what keycode is being sent to the VM when you press keys. This will help troubleshoot what the keyboard is sending.

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - In Ubuntu, open a terminal.
   
2. **Install xev**:
   - Run the command:  
     ```
     sudo apt-get install xev
     ```
   
3. **Run xev**:
   - Type `xev` and press Enter. This will open a small window.
   - Press the key combination you expect to use for "@" and check the output in the terminal to see what keycode is being sent.

This should help you identify the correct key combination or configuration in your Ubuntu VM for typing the "@" symbol.
