# Integrating Gollum Ruby Gem with Editor.js JavaScript Library

## Introduction

Gollum is a popular Ruby gem for building Git-powered wikis. Editor.js is a block-style editor for web content that allows users to create, edit and output structured content. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to integrate Gollum with Editor.js.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby (version 2.3.0 or higher)
- Bundler
- Git

## Step 1: Install Gollum

To install Gollum, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
gem install gollum
```

## Step 2: Create a New Gollum Wiki

To create a new Gollum wiki, navigate to the directory where you want to create the wiki and run the following command:

```
gollum
```

## Step 3: Add Editor.js

To add Editor.js to your Gollum wiki, you need to include the JavaScript library in the `head` section of your HTML file. You can download the library from the official Editor.js website or include it from a CDN by adding the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@editorjs/editorjs@latest"></script>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Editor.js

Once you have added the Editor.js library, you can initialize it in your JavaScript file. To do this, add the following code to your JavaScript file:

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS({
  /**
   * Id of Element that should contain the Editor
   */
  holder: 'editorjs',
  
  /**
   * Available Tools list.
   * Pass Tool's class or Settings object for each Tool you want to use
   */
  tools: {
    /**
     * Allow to paste plain text only
     */
    plainText: {
      class: PlainText,
      inlineToolbar: true,
      config: {
        placeholder: 'Type your text'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Step 5: Save the Content to Gollum

Once you have initialized the Editor.js, you can save the content to Gollum. To do this, you can use the `toMarkdown` method of Editor.js and save the result to Gollum. The following code shows how you can save the content to Gollum:

```javascript
editor.save().then((outputData) => {
  // Save the content to Gollum
  gollum.save(outputData);
});
```

## Conclusion

With these steps, you have successfully integrated Gollum with Editor.js. You can now use Editor.js to create, edit and output structured content in your Gollum wiki.

---

🙋 **You:**

gollum server is running, what should I do next?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If the Gollum server is running, you can access the wiki through a web browser by visiting the URL http://localhost:4567 (or a different port if you specified one when starting the server).

You can then use the Gollum web interface to create and edit pages, add images and other media, and collaborate with others on the content of the wiki. You can also use the Git version control system to keep track of changes to the wiki and collaborate with others.

Additionally, if you have integrated Gollum with other tools, such as Editor.js, you may be able to use additional functionality or customize the appearance and behavior of the wiki.

---

🙋 **You:**

How can I integrate Gollum with Editor.js?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

To integrate Gollum with Editor.js, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Install Gollum: You can install the Gollum Ruby gem by running `gem install gollum` in a terminal window.

2. Create a Gollum Wiki: To create a new Gollum wiki, navigate to the directory where you want to create the wiki and run the command `gollum`.

3. Add Editor.js: To add the Editor.js library to your Gollum wiki, you'll need to include the JavaScript library in the `head` section of your HTML file. You can either download the library or include it from a CDN.

4. Initialize Editor.js: Once you have added the library, you can initialize it in your JavaScript file. You can use the `EditorJS` constructor to create a new instance of the Editor.js editor. You can also configure the editor by specifying the tools you want to use and the settings for each tool.

5. Save the Content to Gollum: Once you have initialized Editor.js, you can use the `toMarkdown` method to convert the content of the editor to Markdown, which can be saved to Gollum. You can do this by calling the `save` method of the Editor.js instance and then saving the output to Gollum.

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate Gollum with Editor.js and use the Editor.js editor to create and edit content in your Gollum wiki.

---

🙋 **You:**

How can I access the web page generated by Gollum in order to add the head and the EditorJS file?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

To access the web page generated by Gollum and add the head and the Editor.js file, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Find the Gollum templates: Gollum uses a set of templates to generate the HTML pages for the wiki. These templates are typically stored in the `gollum/views` directory.

2. Locate the default layout: The default layout for the Gollum pages is usually stored in the `gollum/views/layout.erb` file.

3. Add the head: In the `layout.erb` file, you'll need to add the head section that includes the links to the Editor.js library. You can either link to the library stored on a CDN or include it directly in the `layout.erb` file.

4. Add the Editor.js file: In addition to the head section, you'll also need to add a JavaScript file that initializes the Editor.js editor. You can create a new JavaScript file in the `gollum/public/javascripts` directory, or add the code directly to the `layout.erb` file.

5. Start the Gollum server: Once you've added the head and the JavaScript file, you can start the Gollum server by running the `gollum` command.

By following these steps, you should be able to access the web pages generated by Gollum, add the head and the Editor.js file, and use the Editor.js editor to create and edit content in your Gollum wiki.

---

🙋 **You:**

This is the repo, where can I find the equivalent for that layout.erb? https://github.com/gollum/gollum

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

In the Gollum repository, the equivalent of the `layout.erb` file can be found in the `lib/gollum/views/layout.erb` file. This file defines the default layout for the Gollum pages, including the header and footer of the pages. To add the head and the Editor.js file to the Gollum pages, you'll need to modify this file.

You can add the head section that includes the links to the Editor.js library, and add the JavaScript file that initializes the Editor.js editor. To ensure that your changes persist across updates to the Gollum repository, you can fork the repository and make your changes in your fork. You can then use your fork as the source for your Gollum installation.

---

🙋 **You:**

There's no layouts.erb

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

I apologize, you are correct. The Gollum repository no longer includes an `layout.erb` file in the latest version of the software. Instead, Gollum uses Sinatra to dynamically generate the HTML pages for the wiki.

To integrate Editor.js with Gollum, you'll need to create a custom view or layout in Sinatra and add the necessary code to include the Editor.js library and initialize the editor. You can either create a new file with the custom view or modify the existing views in the `lib/gollum/views` directory.

You'll need to modify the HTML file that represents the page for editing a wiki page, and add the necessary code to include the Editor.js library and initialize the editor. You can also add the necessary code to save the content from the editor to the Gollum repository.

For more information on creating custom views in Sinatra, you can refer to the Sinatra documentation.

---

🙋 **You:**

Provide me the instructions for Sinatra Gollum to add Editor.js to its current folder structure.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Here's how you can add Editor.js to the Sinatra-powered Gollum installation:

1. Clone the Gollum repository: Clone the Gollum repository to your local machine using

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/gollum/gollum.git
```

2. Create a new Sinatra view: Create a new file in the `lib/gollum/views` directory that represents the view for editing a wiki page. This file will contain the necessary HTML code to include the Editor.js library and initialize the editor.

3. Add the head section: In the new file, add the head section that includes the links to the Editor.js library. You can either link to the library stored on a CDN or include it directly in the file.

4. Initialize the editor: In the same file, add the JavaScript code to initialize the Editor.js editor. This code should include a call to the `EditorJS.create` function and specify the necessary configuration options.

5. Save the content: Finally, you'll need to add the code to save the content from the editor to the Gollum repository. This will typically involve sending an HTTP request to the Gollum API to update the content of the wiki page.

6. Update the routes: You'll also need to update the routes in the `lib/gollum/app.rb` file to handle the request to edit the wiki page and render the custom view you created.

7. Start the server: Once you've made these changes, you can start the Gollum server by running the `gollum` command in the terminal.

By following these steps, you should be able to add Editor.js to your Sinatra-powered Gollum installation and use the editor to create and edit content in your wiki.

🙋 **You:**

This is my lib/gollum/views/edit.rb file, where do I add EditorJS?

module Precious
  module Views
    class Edit < Layout
      include Editable
      include HasPage
      include HasMath

      attr_reader :page, :content

      # return path set in app.rb not @page.path
      def path
        @path
      end

      def title
        "#{@page.title}"
      end

      def page_name
        @name
      end

      def header
        if @header.nil?
          if page = @page.header
            @header = page.text_data
          else
            @header = false
          end
        end
        @header
      end

      def footer
        if @footer.nil?
          if page = @page.footer
            @footer = page.text_data
          else
            @footer = false
          end
        end
        @footer
      end

      def sidebar
        if @sidebar.nil?
          if page = @page.sidebar
            @sidebar = page.text_data
          else
            @sidebar = false
          end
        end
        @sidebar
      end

      def is_create_page
        false
      end

      def is_edit_page
        true
      end

      def etag
        @etag
      end

      def allow_uploads
        @allow_uploads
      end

      def format
        @format = (@page.format || false) if @format.nil?
        @format.to_s.downcase
      end
    end
  end
end

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

You can add the Editor.js integration to the `lib/gollum/views/edit.rb` file as follows:

1. Include the head section: In the `edit.rb` file, add the head section that includes the links to the Editor.js library. You can either link to the library stored on a CDN or include it directly in the file.

2. Initialize the editor: In the same file, add the JavaScript code to initialize the Editor.js editor. This code should include a call to the `EditorJS.create` function and specify the necessary configuration options.

3. Update the form: In the `edit.rb` file, update the form that is used to edit the wiki page content to include a textarea element that will be used as the target for the Editor.js editor.

Here's an example of how your `edit.rb` file might look after these changes:

```ruby
module Precious
  module Views
    class Edit < Layout
      include Editable
      include HasPage
      include HasMath

      attr_reader :page, :content

      # return path set in app.rb not @page.path
      def path
        @path
      end

      def title
        "#{@page.title}"
      end

      def page_name
        @name
      end

      def header
        if @header.nil?
          if page = @page.header
            @header = page.text_data
          else
            @header = false
          end
        end
        @header
      end

      def footer
        if @footer.nil?
          if page = @page.footer
            @footer = page.text_data
          else
            @footer = false
          end
        end
        @footer
      end

      def sidebar
        if @sidebar.nil?
          if page = @page.sidebar
            @sidebar = page.text_data
          else
            @sidebar = false
          end
        end
        @sidebar
      end

      def is_create_page
        false
      end

      def is_edit_page
        true
      end

      def etag
        @etag
      end

      def allow_uploads
        @allow_uploads
      end

      def format
        @format = (@page.format || false) if @format.nil?
        @format.to_s.downcase
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And the updated HTML code for the form might look like this:

```html
<form action="<%= @path %>" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put"/>
  <textarea name="content" id="editorjs"></textarea>
  <input type="submit" value="Save"/>
</form>
```

These changes should allow you to integrate the Editor.js library into the Gollum application and use it to edit the content of your wiki pages.

🙋 **You:**

I don’t understand. Check gollum github repo and tell me how to integrate editor js easily to gollum editor.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Unfortunately, I can't find any existing example or guide for integrating Editor.js with Gollum. The best way to integrate the two would be to modify the HTML and JavaScript files that Gollum uses to display its editing interface and add the necessary code to include Editor.js in those files. To do this, you would need to modify the existing views, such as the "edit.rb" file that you shared, to include the necessary HTML and JavaScript code for Editor.js.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Unfortunately, Gollum does not have a built-in integration with Editor.js. You would need to modify the Gollum codebase or create your own custom solution in order to integrate the two.

Here's an outline of the steps you would need to follow to add Editor.js to Gollum:

1. Include the necessary files for Editor.js in your Gollum project, either by downloading them or linking to a CDN.

2. Modify the edit page template for Gollum to include the Editor.js initialization code. This might involve adding a new section to the template file to load the Editor.js library, as well as customizing the textarea that is used for the Gollum editor to make use of Editor.js.

3. In your Gollum server-side code, you'll need to modify the behavior of the editor to use Editor.js instead of the built-in text editor. This might involve creating a new controller or view that integrates the two, or modifying the existing edit page code to use Editor.js instead.

4. Finally, you'll need to test and debug your changes to make sure everything is working correctly.

Note: This is just an outline, and the exact steps required to integrate Editor.js with Gollum will vary depending on your specific needs and the version of Gollum that you are using. If you are not comfortable with programming or web development, it might be best to seek the help of a professional.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

and the location on the file system where the repository will be stored.

4. Add user authentication to your Rails application, so that users can register and log in to their own accounts.

5. In your Rails controller, create an action that creates a new Gollum repository for each user who registers. This action should use the Gollum gem to create a new Git repository on the file system and initialize it with a default set of files, such as a `Home.md` file.

6. Create a view that displays the Gollum wiki for the user's repository. This view should use the Gollum gem to render the pages in the user's repository, allowing the user to view and edit their wiki pages.

7. Add a form to the view that allows users to edit and save their wiki pages. This form should use the Gollum gem to update the corresponding files in the user's repository.

8. Test and debug your changes to make sure everything is working correctly.

Note: This is just an outline, and the exact steps required to integrate Gollum with a Rails application will vary depending on your specific needs and the version of Rails that you are using. If you are not comfortable with programming or web development, it might be best to seek the help of a professional.

🙋 **You:**

Should I use cancancan or pundit for the authorization

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Both CanCanCan and Pundit are popular authorization libraries for Ruby on Rails applications, and both can be used to control access to resources in a Gollum wiki.

CanCanCan provides a simple and straightforward way to define authorization rules for a Rails application. It uses a single `ability.rb` file to define the permissions for different roles in the application.

Pundit, on the other hand, provides a more granular approach to authorization by using policy classes for each resource. This allows for more complex authorization rules and better separation of concerns between the authorization logic and the rest of the application.

Ultimately, the choice between CanCanCan and Pundit will depend on the specific requirements of your application. If you have a simple authorization setup, CanCanCan may be sufficient. However, if you need a more complex authorization setup, Pundit may be a better choice.

🙋 **You:**

How can I create a Sinatra Gollum instance for every registered user in Rails? Tell me about the implementation details

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

To create a Sinatra Gollum instance for every registered user in a Rails application, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a new Sinatra application that will serve as the Gollum instance. This can be done by creating a new Ruby file in your Rails application's `lib` directory, for example, `gollum.rb`.

2. In this file, require the necessary dependencies for Gollum and Sinatra, such as the `gollum` and `sinatra` gems.

3. Define a new Sinatra application, using the `Sinatra::Application` class. This will be the entry point for the Gollum instance.

4. Within this application, create a new Gollum repository for each registered user. You can use the Gollum gem to create the Git repository and initialize it with a default set of files.

5. Define the necessary routes for your Gollum instance. This will typically include routes for viewing and editing pages in the wiki, as well as routes for handling user authentication and authorization.

6. Finally, start the Sinatra application using the `run` method, and ensure that it is listening on a unique port for each Gollum instance.

Here is an example implementation of a Sinatra Gollum instance for a Rails application:

```ruby
# In lib/gollum.rb
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'gollum'

class GollumApp < Sinatra::Application
  set :gollum_path, -> { File.join(settings.root, "wiki") }

  before do
    # Authenticate user here
  end

  get '/' do
    # Display the home page of the wiki
    wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new(settings.gollum_path)
    wiki.page('Home').formatted_data
  end

  get '/page/:id' do
    # Display the requested wiki page
    wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new(settings.gollum_path)
    page = wiki.page(params[:id])
    page.formatted_data
  end

  post '/page/:id' do
    # Update the requested wiki page
    wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new(settings.gollum_path)
    page = wiki.page(params[:id])
    page.update(params[:content])
    redirect to("/page/#{params[:id]}")
  end
end
```

In your Rails application, you can then create a new Gollum instance for each registered user by running the following code:

```ruby
# In your Rails controller
def create_gollum_instance(user)
  # Generate a unique port for the Gollum instance
  port = 8000 + user.id

  # Start the Sinatra application on the unique port
  Thread.new do
    Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run(
      GollumApp.new,
      :Port => port,
      :Host => 'localhost'
    )
  end
end
```

This code creates a new Gollum instance for the given user and starts it on a unique port. You can then store the port number in the user's database record, and use it to redirect the user to their own Gollum instance when they access the wiki.

🙋 **You:**

What would be the easiest way to handle routes or subdomains? Consider both local development, testing and deployment

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

There are different ways to handle routes or subdomains in a Rails application. One way is to use the `constraints` option in the routes file. This option allows you to specify a regular expression that must match the request's subdomain or other attributes in order to apply the route.

For example, to handle subdomains in your Rails application, you could use the `constraints` option in the routes file like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  constraints subdomain: 'gollum' do
    mount Gollum::RackAdapter.new(
      wiki_options: {
        universal_toc: false,
        allow_editing: true,
        live_preview: true,
        allow_uploads: true,
        per_page_uploads: true
      }
    ), at: '/'
  end
end
```

This example will mount the Gollum instance at the subdomain `gollum`. Requests to any other subdomain will not be routed to the Gollum instance.

For local development and testing, you can use a tool like `lvh.me` which resolves to `127.0.0.1`. This way, you can test subdomains locally without having to set up a DNS.

For deployment, you will need to configure your DNS provider to point the desired subdomain to your server's IP address or domain name. Then, you can use the `constraints` option to route requests to the Gollum instance based on the subdomain.

---

🙋 **You:**

Give two examples of wiki subdomains for two different users, both locally and how it would look in production, according to your previous answer.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Sure! Here are two examples of wiki subdomains for different users, both locally and in production:

**Example 1:**

- User: "Alice"
- Local subdomain: `alice.localhost:3000`
- Production subdomain: `alice.example.com`

To configure the subdomain for Alice's wiki instance, you would add the following code to the `routes.rb` file:

```ruby
constraints subdomain: 'alice' do
  mount Gollum::RackAdapter.new(
    wiki_options: {
      universal_toc: false,
      allow_editing: true,
      live_preview: true,
      allow_uploads: true,
      per_page_uploads: true
    }
  ), at: '/'
end
```

In development, you can access Alice's wiki instance by visiting `alice.localhost:3000` in your web browser. In production, you would need to set up DNS to point `alice.example.com` to your server's IP address or domain name.

**Example 2:**

- User: "Bob"
- Local subdomain: `bob.localhost:3000`
- Production subdomain: `bob.example.com`

To configure the subdomain for Bob's wiki instance, you would add the following code to the `routes.rb` file:

```ruby
constraints subdomain: 'bob' do
  mount Gollum::RackAdapter.new(
    wiki_options: {
      universal_toc: false,
      allow_editing: true,
      live_preview: true,
      allow_uploads: true,
      per_page_uploads: true
    }
  ), at: '/'
end
```

In development, you can access Bob's wiki instance by visiting `bob.localhost:3000` in your web browser. In production, you would need to set up DNS to point `bob.example.com` to your server's IP address or domain name.

🙋 **You:**

Does it make sense to use docker containers for this application development?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Yes, using Docker containers for developing and deploying the application can provide several benefits, including:

1. **Consistency:** With Docker, you can create a consistent development environment for all team members, ensuring that everyone is using the same versions of dependencies and libraries. This can reduce the likelihood of issues arising due to differences in development environments.

2. **Portability:** Docker containers can be easily moved between environments, making it easier to deploy the application to different servers or cloud platforms.

3. **Isolation:** Each container runs in its own isolated environment, which can help to prevent conflicts between different parts of the application.

4. **Scalability:** Docker makes it easier to scale the application horizontally by running multiple instances of the application in separate containers.

5. **Reproducibility:** By defining the application environment as code in a Dockerfile, you can ensure that the environment is reproducible and can be easily rebuilt if necessary.

Overall, using Docker for developing and deploying the application can help to simplify the development process and make it easier to manage and scale the application in the future.

🙋 **You:**

Provide a tutorial for docker considering the gollum instances within the application that we have discussed before

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Sure, here is a step-by-step tutorial for using Docker to deploy multiple Gollum instances within a Rails application:

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**

Make sure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your development machine. You can download and install them from the Docker website.

2. **Create a Dockerfile for Gollum**

Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Rails application with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7-alpine

RUN apk add --update \
    build-base \
    git \
    ruby-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libxslt-dev \
    sqlite-dev \
    nodejs \
    npm \
    yarn

RUN gem install gollum

WORKDIR /app
```

This Dockerfile will use the Alpine Linux-based Ruby 2.7 image as the base image, install the necessary dependencies and install Gollum.

3. **Create a Docker Compose file**

Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory of your Rails application with the following content:

```yml
version: '3.9'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres@db:5432/app

  db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: app

  gollum:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      WIKI_NAME: "My Wiki"
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    depends_on:
      - db

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

This Docker Compose file defines three services: the Rails application, the PostgreSQL database, and the Gollum wiki server. The `volumes` section mounts the `data` and `config` directories to the corresponding directories inside the Gollum container.

4. **Start the Docker Compose stack**

Run the following command to start the Docker Compose stack:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start all three services: the Rails application, the PostgreSQL database, and the Gollum wiki server.

5. **Access the Gollum instance**

You can now access the Gollum instance by visiting `http://localhost:4567` in your web browser. 

6. **Add multiple Gollum instances**

To add multiple Gollum instances for different users, you can create a new Docker Compose service for each user's wiki server, similar to the `gollum` service defined in the previous step. Each service should use a different port number and mount a different directory for the wiki data and configuration. 

For example, you could add the following service to the Docker Compose file to create a Gollum instance for user `john`:

```yml
  gollum_john:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./data/john:/data
      - ./config/john:/config
    environment:
      WIKI_NAME: "John's Wiki"
    ports:
      - "4568:4567"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

This service uses port `4568` and

🙋 **You:**

What is the difference between gollum and gollum-lib from https://github.com/gollum?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

`gollum` is a full-fledged wiki software that provides a web interface for creating and managing wikis. It is built on top of the `gollum-lib` library, which provides the core functionality for working with Gollum's underlying Git repository and Markdown rendering.

In other words, `gollum-lib` is the library that powers the Gollum wiki software. It can be used independently of the full `gollum` application, for example, to build custom wiki applications or integrate with other tools. On the other hand, `gollum` is a standalone application that uses `gollum-lib` to provide a web interface for creating and managing wikis.

---

🙋 **You:**

If I want to integrate gollum into a rails application to generate a gollum wiki under rails devise user account, which one should I pick and how do I implement that feature?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

For your use case, you should use `gollum-lib` to integrate with your Rails application. You can use the library to create and manage Git repositories for each user, and use Gollum's Markdown rendering capabilities to display the content.

Here are the steps you can follow to integrate `gollum-lib` into your Rails application:

1. Install `gollum-lib` by adding the following line to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'gollum-lib'
   ```

2. Create a new Git repository for each user when they sign up for your application. You can use the `git` command-line tool or the `rugged` Ruby gem to create the repository.

3. Configure a `Gollum::Wiki` object for each user's repository. You can use the following code to initialize the wiki:

   ```ruby
   wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new('/path/to/repo')
   ```

   You can use this object to interact with the wiki, for example, to create or update pages.

4. Integrate the wiki with your application's user interface. You can use a controller action to render the contents of a page, and a form to allow users to edit or create pages.

   For example, you can create a `PagesController` with the following actions:

   ```ruby
   class PagesController < ApplicationController
     def show
       @page = wiki.page(params[:id])
     end

     def edit
       @page = wiki.page(params[:id])
     end

     def update
       page = wiki.page(params[:id])
       page.update(params[:content], message: params[:message])
       redirect_to page_path(page)
     end

     def create
       page = wiki.write_page(params[:title], :markdown, params[:content], message: params[:message])
       redirect_to page_path(page)
     end

     private

     def wiki
       @wiki ||= Gollum::Wiki.new('/path/to/repo')
     end
   end
   ```

   You can then create corresponding views to render the page and form templates for each action.

5. Secure the wiki so that only authenticated users can access it. You can use the `devise` gem to manage user authentication and authorization.

   For example, you can define a `WikiPolicy` with the following rules:

   ```ruby
   class WikiPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
     def show?
       true
     end

     def edit?
       user.present?
     end

     def update?
       user.present?
     end

     def create?
       user.present?
     end
   end
   ```

   You can then use the `authorize` method in your controller actions to check if the user is authorized to perform the action.

   ```ruby
   class PagesController < ApplicationController
     def edit
       @page = wiki.page(params[:id])
       authorize @page, :edit?
     end

     def update
       page = wiki.page(params[:id])
       authorize page, :update?
       page.update(params[:content], message: params[:message])
       redirect_to page_path(page)
     end

     def create
       authorize Page, :create?
       page = wiki.write_page(params[:title], :markdown, params[:content], message: params[:message])
       redirect_to page_path(page)
     end
   end
   ```

6. Test your implementation thoroughly, both locally and in your production environment, to ensure that it works as expected.

Note that this is a basic outline of the steps involved in integrating `gollum-lib` with your Rails application. You may need to customize the implementation based on your specific requirements and use

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message indicates that the installation of the gem "rugged" failed due to a missing dependency "cmake". To fix the issue, you need to install cmake in your Docker container. You can do this by adding the following command to your Dockerfile:

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake
```

This command will update the package list and install cmake in the container. After adding this command, rebuild the Docker container and try installing the "rugged" gem again.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message indicates that building the native extension of the Rugged gem failed due to missing necessary libraries and/or headers. The error occurred during the execution of `extconf.rb` which failed to create a Makefile. The error message suggests checking the `mkmf.log` file for more details. The log file should be located in `/usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/3.2.0/rugged-1.1.1/mkmf.log`. The specific error message in this case is an undefined method `exists?' for Dir:Class (NoMethodError), which suggests that the `Dir` class does not have a method called `exists?`. Instead, the method `exist?` should be used instead.

---

🙋 **You:**

How can I fix it?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message suggests that there was a problem building the Rugged gem's native extension. To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the mkmf.log file located in /usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/3.2.0/rugged-1.1.1/ to see the reason why the extension failed to compile.

2. Make sure that all necessary libraries and headers are installed.

3. Try reinstalling the Rugged gem with the following command:

   `gem install rugged -- --use-system-libraries`

4. If step 3 does not work, you can try installing the missing dependencies and then reinstalling the Rugged gem. The specific dependencies that you need to install will depend on the error message in the mkmf.log file.

---

🙋 **You:**

How can I access it if it's inside my docker container?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

You can access a service running inside a Docker container in a few ways, depending on how the container is configured:

1. If the container is running in the default bridge network mode, you can use the container's IP address to access the service. You can find the IP address of a running container by running the command `docker inspect <container-name>`.

2. If the container is running in a user-defined network mode, you can access the service using the container's hostname. By default, Docker will create a DNS entry for the container's hostname that resolves to the container's IP address.

3. If the container is running with port mapping enabled (e.g., `-p 8080:80`), you can access the service by accessing the host's IP address with the exposed port number. For example, if you mapped port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host, you can access the service by visiting `http://<host-ip>:8080` in a web browser.

Note that these are just general guidelines, and the exact steps required to access the service may depend on the specific configuration of your container and network environment.

🙋 **You:**

How can I fix that rugged gem installation issue? Consider the docker file shared

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

One solution to fix the rugged gem installation issue could be to install the required dependencies before installing the gem. You can update your Dockerfile with the following lines before the `gem install bundler` command:

```
RUN apk add --update --no-cache \
  build-base \
  cmake \
  openssl-dev \
  linux-headers \
  git

RUN gem install rugged -v '1.1.0' -- --use-system-libraries
```

This will install the necessary dependencies like build-base, cmake, openssl-dev, linux-headers, and git, and then install the rugged gem with the `--use-system-libraries` flag which will use the already installed dependencies. This should resolve the rugged gem installation issue.

🙋 **You:**

How can I access the log file within the docker container in vscode?
/usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/3.2.0/rugged-1.1.0/mkmf.log

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

You can access the log file within the docker container in VSCode by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal in VSCode by clicking on the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".
2. Use the `docker ps` command to get the container ID of the container that has the log file you want to access.
3. Use the `docker exec` command to execute a command inside the container and access the log file. For example, if the container ID is `123abc`, and the log file is located at `/usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/3.2.0/rugged-1.1.0/mkmf.log`, you can use the following command:

   ```
   docker exec -it 123abc cat /usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/3.2.0/rugged-1.1.0/mkmf.log
   ```

   This will output the contents of the log file to the terminal.

4. You can then copy the contents of the log file from the terminal and paste it into a new file in VSCode for further analysis.

---

🙋 **You:**

It says the container doesnt exist

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you're unable to access the container because it doesn't exist, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The container was not created properly: Make sure you've created the container properly using the `docker create` or `docker run` command.

2. The container was stopped or removed: If you've stopped or removed the container, it will no longer exist. You can check if the container is stopped or removed using the `docker ps -a` command.

3. The container is running on a different host: If you're using Docker in a distributed environment, it's possible that the container is running on a different host. In this case, you may need to access the container using the IP address or hostname of the host where the container is running.

Once you've identified the reason why the container doesn't exist, you can take appropriate action to create or access the container.

The error message suggests that the installation of the `rugged` gem failed because it expected `libgit2` version 1.1.0 but it found a different version. To fix this issue, you can try installing the compatible version of `libgit2` or update the `rugged` gem to a version that is compatible with the installed `libgit2` version. Additionally, you can check the `mkmf.log` file for more details on the specific issue.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The logs suggest that the installation of the gem `rugged` failed due to a native extension build error. The error message says that the version of `libgit2` library installed is not compatible with the version expected by the gem `rugged`. The logs recommend checking the `mkmf.log` file for more details.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The Docker container build failed due to an error while installing the "rugged" gem. The error message indicates that there was a problem building the gem's native extension, and that the libgit2 library version is not compatible. The error code was 1, and the full error output is available in the logs.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The Docker build failed while trying to install the `rugged` gem with version `1.4.4` using the command `gem install rugged -v '1.4.4' -- --use-system-libraries`. The error message indicates that the `libgit2` version is not compatible and expected `~> 1.4.0`. The logs suggest checking the `mkmf.log` file for more details.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The version of gollum-rugged_adapter and rugged are incompatible with the required versions by gollum-lib in Gemfile, resulting in a failed version solving.

---

🙋 **You:**

Which would be the right version?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on the error message, it seems like there is no compatible version of the dependencies that satisfy the requirements specified in the Gemfile. Specifically, there is a conflict between the required versions of gollum-rugged_adapter and rugged. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the right version to use. However, one potential solution could be to try adjusting the version requirements in the Gemfile to find a compatible set of dependencies. Alternatively, you could seek assistance from the library maintainers or community to find a solution to the dependency conflict.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message indicates that some gems are missing and need to be installed with `bundle install`. Additionally, there seems to be a syntax error in the `mime-types` gem's logger file. This error may need to be fixed by updating the `mime-types` gem or downgrading the Ruby version.

---

🙋 **You:**

Why got that error with bundler if it bundled properly?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message suggests that some gems are missing and the command `bundle install` should be run to install them. This means that bundler was not able to install all the necessary gems properly during the previous bundling process, or some gems might have been deleted or become incompatible with the current environment. Running `bundle install` should resolve this issue.

---

🙋 **You:**

How can I bundle install? Do I have to do it within the docker container?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Yes, you can run `bundle install` command within the Docker container to install the missing gems. Here's an example command to run it inside the container:

```
docker exec -it <container_name> bundle install
```

Replace `<container_name>` with the name or ID of your container. This command will start a shell session in the container and execute `bundle install` inside it.

Alternatively, you can also rebuild the Docker image with the updated dependencies by running `docker-compose build`. This will rebuild the image using the updated `Gemfile.lock` file, which should include the missing gems.

Error response from daemon: Container b7d66ff49d39e744985c02656473ec4fd4b9389ecf16d02f128c4b922c951712 is not running
Why it says that if I have another terminal with docker-compose up --build?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message indicates that the container with the specified ID `b7d66ff49d39e744985c02656473ec4fd4b9389ecf16d02f128c4b922c951712` is not currently running. This could happen if the container was stopped or if it failed to start. 

If you have another terminal running `docker-compose up --build`, it's possible that the container was stopped due to an error during the build process. You can check the logs of the container to see if there are any error messages that could help you diagnose the issue. 

If you want to start the container again, you can use the `docker-compose start` command instead of `docker-compose up --build`, as `start` will attempt to start any stopped containers created by the `docker-compose` file.

---

🙋 **You:**

if it failed to start, how can I run bundle install over it then? navi_app is the container's name

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If the container failed to start, you can still run commands inside the container using `docker-compose run`. For example, to run `bundle install` inside the `navi_app` container, you can use the following command:

```
docker-compose run navi_app bundle install
```

This command will start a new container based on the `navi_app` service definition in your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the `bundle install` command inside it. Once the command completes, the container will be stopped and removed automatically.

---

🙋 **You:**

no such service: navi_app

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message "no such service" indicates that Docker Compose cannot find a service with the specified name in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Please make sure that the name of the service you're trying to run is correct and matches the service name in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you're not sure about the service name or you want to list all available services in your `docker-compose.yml` file, you can run the following command:

```
docker-compose config --services
```

This will list all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message suggests that there is a syntax error in the file `/usr/local/bundle/gems/mime-types-2.99.3/lib/mime/types/logger.rb`. Specifically, the reserved numbered parameters `_1`, `_2`, and `_3` are being used improperly. This could be caused by an outdated or incompatible version of the Ruby programming language, or an incompatible version of a dependency library. You may need to update your Ruby version or the dependencies to resolve this error.

🙋 **You:**

container for service "bg" is unhealthy

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

This error message indicates that the container for the "bg" service is currently in an unhealthy state. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as an application or runtime error, resource constraints, or networking issues. You may need to investigate the logs or metrics for the container to determine the root cause of the issue and take appropriate actions to resolve it.

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on the provided output, it looks like the server is running but there could be some issue with the application itself. It is recommended to check the logs of the navi_app container for any error messages that could indicate what the problem might be. You can do this by running `docker-compose logs navi_app` in another terminal window while the containers are still running. Additionally, make sure that you have specified the correct port in the URL when accessing the server.

That's my docker-compose file. Everything compiles properly but localhost:3000 doesn't load

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on the docker-compose file, the `app` service is listening on the `${PORT_EXPOSED}` port, which is mapped to the `${PORT}` of the container. Make sure that you are accessing the correct port in your web browser. If `${PORT_EXPOSED}` is set to 3000, try accessing `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Also, check if there are any errors or warnings in the logs of the `app` service. You can view the logs by running `docker-compose logs app` in your terminal. This might help you identify any issues with your application.

---

🙋 **You:**

port exposed is 3001, port is 3000

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on your `docker-compose.yml` file, you are exposing port `3001` to the host (`${PORT_EXPOSED}:${PORT}`), but your Rails server is running on port `3000`. 

Try accessing your Rails server through `localhost:3001` in your web browser instead of `localhost:3000`.

---

🙋 **You:**

Didn't work

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If changing the port exposed to 3000 didn't work, then it's possible that there's an issue with the application itself. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the logs of the application container to see if there are any error messages that might give you a clue as to what's wrong. You can do this by running `docker-compose logs app`.

2. Make sure that the Rails server is actually running. You can check this by running `docker-compose exec app ps aux | grep rails`. If the server is running, you should see a process with the command line containing `rails server`.

3. Try accessing the Rails server directly by going to `localhost:3000` in your web browser. If you see an error message or a blank page, then there's something wrong with the Rails application itself.

4. Check that you don't have any other processes already running on port 3000, as this could be causing a conflict. You can check this by running `lsof -i :3000`.

Hopefully one of these steps will help you identify the issue and get your Rails application up and running.

---

🙋 **You:**

lsof -i :3000 doesn't return anything

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If `lsof -i :3000` doesn't return anything, it could mean that no process is listening on port 3000 on your local machine. 

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, you are mapping the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3001 using the following configuration:

```
ports:
  - '${PORT_EXPOSED}:${PORT}'
```

Therefore, you should be able to access the application by visiting `localhost:3001` on your host machine.

If you are still unable to access the application, you may want to check if your container is running using the command `docker ps`. If it is running, try restarting the container using `docker-compose restart app` and then see if you can access it. If it is not running, you can start it using `docker-compose up -d`.

---

🙋 **You:**

docker ps returns 87231af02c32   navi_app                      "sh -cx 'rm -f tmp/p…"   10 minutes ago   Up About a minute (healthy)   0.0.0.0:3001->3000/tcp                           navi_app

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on the `docker ps` output you shared, the `navi_app` container is running and should be accessible via `localhost:3001` since the container's port `3000` is mapped to the host's port `3001`. Please make sure that you are accessing `localhost:3001` in your web browser instead of `localhost:3000`.

---

🙋 **You:**

localhost didn’t send any data.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you see the message "localhost didn't send any data" in your browser after trying to access your application at `localhost:3001`, there could be a few possible reasons:

1. The application is not running: Check if your Docker container is still running by running the command `docker ps`. If you don't see the container listed, then it may have stopped for some reason. Try starting it again with `docker-compose up`.

2. The container is running, but the application is not responding: In this case, it's possible that the application is running but not responding to requests for some reason. Check the logs of your container by running `docker logs <container_name>`. Look for any error messages that may indicate a problem with your application.

3. A firewall is blocking the connection: Check if you have any firewalls (such as Windows Firewall or a third-party firewall) that may be blocking incoming connections to port 3001. If so, you may need to configure the firewall to allow incoming connections to the port.

4. Incorrect URL: Ensure that you're accessing the correct URL. In this case, it should be `http://localhost:3001`, not `https://localhost:3001` or any other variation.

I hope this helps!

---

🙋 **You:**

Any of those things helped, what else I can do?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If none of the previous steps helped, you can try the following:

1. Check your browser's console log for any errors that might give you a clue as to what's happening.

2. Try accessing the container directly by using its IP address instead of localhost. You can find the IP address of the container by running `docker inspect <container-id> | grep IPAddress`.

3. Check your firewall settings to make sure that incoming traffic on port 3001 is allowed.

4. Try restarting the Docker service and see if that solves the problem.

5. If you're running Docker on a virtual machine, make sure that the network settings are correctly configured.

6. Check your application logs to see if there are any errors or exceptions that might give you a clue as to what's happening. You can view the logs by running `docker logs <container-id>`.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you identify the issue and get your application running.

---

🙋 **You:**

What other file you need to help?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are building and running the containers successfully, then the next step would be to check the application logs for any error messages or indications of what might be causing the issue. 

You can try running the following command to see the logs for the app container:

```
docker-compose logs app
```

This will show the logs for the app container, which may help you identify any issues that are preventing the application from loading in the browser.

---

🙋 **You:**

Any rails config file that could help?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Sure, here are some files that might be helpful:

1. `config/database.yml`: This file contains the configuration settings for your database, including the database name, host, port, username, and password.
2. `config/application.rb`: This file contains configuration settings for your Rails application, such as the default time zone, the application name, and more.
3. `config/routes.rb`: This file contains the routing configuration for your application, including the mapping of URLs to controllers and actions.
4. `config/environment.rb`: This file is loaded when your application boots and can be used to set environment variables or perform other initialization tasks.
5. `config/puma.rb`: This file contains the configuration settings for the Puma web server, including the number of worker processes, the thread pool size, and more.

If you provide more information about the issue you are facing, I might be able to point you in the direction of a specific file that could be helpful.

---

🙋 **You:**

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV['DATABASE_POOL'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['DATABASE_USERNAME'] %>
  password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.database.password %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: navi_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: navi_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: navi_production

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

This is the content of `config/database.yml`, which defines the database configuration for different environments. It specifies that the application will use PostgreSQL as the database adapter, and defines the database name, host, port, pool size, and authentication credentials for each environment. The actual values for some of these parameters are read from environment variables or Rails credentials.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on the provided files, it seems that everything is set up correctly. However, since the server is not responding, it might be helpful to check the Rails logs to see if there are any error messages that could give a clue as to what's happening.

You can try running `docker-compose logs app` to see the logs for the app container. If you see any error messages or warnings, that could be a good starting point to investigate further.

---

🙋 **You:**

it doesn't have any error. Provide betteroptions

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If none of the previous solutions have worked, here are a few more options to try:

1. Check the logs of the Rails server container using the `docker logs` command. You can run `docker logs -f navi_app` to follow the logs in real time. Look for any error messages that might indicate what's going wrong.

2. Make sure that the Rails server is actually running inside the container. You can run `docker exec navi_app ps aux` to see the running processes inside the container. Look for a process named something like `ruby bin/rails server`.

3. Try accessing the Rails server from another container on the same network. You can create a new container and run a curl command to the IP address of the Rails server container on port 3000 or 3001 (whichever you're using). For example: `docker run --rm --network=<network_name> curlimages/curl curl http://navi_app:3000`. This will help you determine if the problem is with the Rails server container itself or with the way you're trying to access it from your host machine.

4. Try running the Rails server outside of Docker to see if it works correctly. This will help you determine if the problem is with the Docker setup or with the Rails application itself. To do this, navigate to your Rails application directory and run `bundle exec rails server -p 3000`. Then try accessing `localhost:3000` in your web browser. If the Rails server works correctly, the problem is likely with your Docker setup.

Hopefully one of these options will help you figure out what's going wrong!

---

🙋 **You:**

What is the network name?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

You can view the network names of your Docker containers using the command `docker network ls`. This will list all the networks created in Docker, along with their names, IDs, and driver used. If you have not created a custom network for your containers, they will most likely be on the default `bridge` network.

---

🙋 **You:**

docker run --rm --network=navi_default curlimages/curl curl http://navi_app:3000 returned the following error:
  <h1>Blocked host: navi_app</h1>

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message "Blocked host: navi_app" suggests that your Rails application is blocking requests from the host name "navi_app". This can happen if you have configured your Rails application to only allow requests from certain hosts, or if you have configured it to block requests from certain hosts.

To fix this issue, you can check your Rails application configuration to see if there are any settings that are blocking requests from the "navi_app" host. You may also want to check your Docker network configuration to make sure that the "navi_app" container is correctly configured to receive incoming requests.

One possible solution is to update the configuration of your Rails application to allow requests from the "navi_app" host. You can do this by adding the following line to your Rails configuration file:

```
config.hosts << "navi_app"
```

This will allow incoming requests from the "navi_app" host. Once you have made this change, try running the "curl" command again to see if the error has been resolved.

---

🙋 **You:**

❯ docker run --rm --network=navi_default curlimages/curl curl http://localhost:3000 and localhost:3001 say couldnt connect to server

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you are not able to access the application through `localhost:3001` or `localhost:3000` after running the `docker-compose up` command, it may be that the application is not running correctly or there is an issue with the configuration. Here are some things you can try:

1. Check the logs of the application container by running `docker logs navi_app`. This will show any errors or issues with the application.

2. Check the Docker network settings by running `docker network inspect navi_default`. This will show the IP address of the application container, which you can use to access the application.

3. Try accessing the application using the IP address of the application container instead of `localhost`. You can get the IP address of the application container by running `docker inspect navi_app | grep IPAddress`.

4. Check your firewall settings to ensure that the required ports are open.

5. If you have any custom configurations in your `config/database.yml` or `config/application.rb` files, double-check them to make sure they are correct.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you access your application.

🤖 **Assistant:**

The output shows the details of the `navi_default` Docker network, including the subnet, gateway, and IP addresses of the containers connected to it. There are five containers connected to the network, named `navi_bg`, `navi_app`, `navi_js`, `navi_kv`, and `navi_smtp`.

---

🙋 **You:**

So why I can't connect to the rails app?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The error message "Blocked host: navi_app" suggests that the Rails app is blocking requests from the host you're trying to connect from. One possible reason could be that the Rails app is not configured to allow connections from outside the container network. To allow connections from outside the container network, you may need to configure the Rails app to bind to the container's IP address or to listen on all available IP addresses (0.0.0.0). Additionally, you may need to configure any firewalls or security groups to allow incoming traffic on the appropriate port.

---

🙋 **You:**

Please refine your answer considering you got my docker-compose config

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Based on your `docker-compose.yml` configuration, the Rails app is running on port 3000 inside the `navi_app` container, and it is exposed to the Docker network via port 3000. However, it seems like you are trying to access the app using `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001` from outside the Docker network, which will not work.

To access the Rails app from outside the Docker network, you need to use the IP address of the Docker network gateway, which in your case is `172.18.0.1`. Therefore, you can try accessing the Rails app using `http://172.18.0.1:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`. If you are still unable to connect, make sure that the Rails app is running and listening on port 3000 inside the `navi_app` container by running `docker-compose ps` and checking the container logs using `docker-compose logs navi_app`.

---

🙋 **You:**

http://172.18.0.1:3000 didn't send any data

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

This error message typically indicates that your browser was able to connect to the server, but the server did not send a response back. There could be several reasons for this, such as:

- The server is taking too long to respond and the connection timed out
- The server is not properly configured or has crashed
- There is a network issue between your machine and the server

You can try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check if the server is running properly by running `docker-compose ps` and verifying that the container for your Rails app is running.
- Try accessing the Rails app from inside the container using `docker-compose exec app curl http://localhost:3000` to see if the app is responding correctly.
- Check the logs for the Rails container using `docker-compose logs app` to see if there are any errors.
- Verify that there are no firewall rules blocking the connection.
- Try accessing the app from a different machine or network to see if the issue is specific to your environment.

These steps should help you diagnose and resolve the issue.

---

🙋 **You:**

it does bring an html response with that curl

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you're able to get an HTML response from the Rails app using `curl http://172.18.0.1:3000`, then it's possible that there's an issue with your browser or the network connection.

Here are some things you can try:

- Clear your browser's cache and cookies
- Try accessing the app using a different browser or device
- Check your network connection to make sure it's stable and not blocking the connection to the Rails app
- Try accessing the app from a different network, such as a mobile hotspot or a different Wi-Fi network

If none of these solutions work, it's possible there's an issue with the Rails app itself. You can check the logs of the Rails app by running `docker-compose logs app` and see if there are any errors or issues that may be preventing the app from responding properly.

What else we can do now?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Since you were able to get a response from the Rails app using `curl`, it means that the app is running and responding properly. However, since you're not able to access the app via the browser using the IP address and port, it might be a firewall issue or a DNS resolution issue. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Try accessing the app via `localhost` instead of the IP address. For example, try accessing `http://localhost:3000` instead of `http://172.18.0.1:3000`.
2. Check your firewall settings to make sure that port 3000 is open and accessible from outside the container.
3. Check your DNS settings to make sure that the hostname `172.18.0.1` resolves properly to the IP address of the Docker host. You can try adding an entry to your `hosts` file to map the hostname to the IP address. For example, add a line like this to your `hosts` file: `172.18.0.1 myapp.local` and try accessing the app via `http://myapp.local:3000` in your browser.

🙋 **You:**

How can I know if it is due to a firewall?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If you suspect that the connection issue is due to a firewall, you can check if the firewall is blocking traffic on the required ports. 

One way to do this is to use a tool like `telnet` or `nc` (netcat) to test if you can connect to the Rails app port from the host machine or from another machine in the same network. For example, you can run the following command on the host machine:

```
telnet 172.18.0.1 3000
```

If the connection is successful, you should see a message like "Connected to 172.18.0.1". If the connection fails, it could be due to a firewall blocking the traffic.

You can also check the firewall rules on the host machine or the network to see if there are any rules that could be blocking the traffic. Depending on the type of firewall, the steps to check the rules may vary.

---

🙋 **You:**

nc 172.18.0.1 3000 didn't return anything

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

If running `nc 172.18.0.1 3000` didn't return anything, it means that there is no active connection between your Docker container and the host machine on port 3000. This could be due to several reasons, one of which is a firewall rule blocking the connection.

To check if a firewall is blocking the connection, you can try temporarily disabling the firewall on the host machine and then attempt to connect to the Rails app again. If the connection is successful after disabling the firewall, then it is likely that a firewall rule was blocking the connection.

You can also check the firewall rules on the host machine to see if there are any rules that could be blocking the connection. This will vary depending on your operating system and firewall software.

What are the most common services across complex software systems that are required to implement a modular approach. Let's say I want to start with a writing engine and then starting a few other services around, including an online school, media server, pdf manager, payment system, etc. Would it be better to use a monolithic approach first and then decentralize it or start with specific services first to iimplement such modular way?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

When building complex software systems, it's generally best to start with a clear design and architecture in mind, considering whether you'll go with a monolithic or microservice (modular) architecture. Both approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best approach depends on your specific circumstances, including the size and experience of your team, your expected scale, the complexity of your services, and more.

Common services across complex systems often include:

1. User Management/Auth Service: This handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
2. Payment Service: If your app involves financial transactions, a service dedicated to handling this is essential.
3. Notification Service: For handling all kinds of user notifications, both internal (within the system) and external (emails, SMS messages, etc.).
4. File Management/Storage Service: A service for handling file uploads, storage, and retrieval, especially for media servers and PDF managers.
5. Search Service: Depending on the scale and type of your system, having a dedicated search service might be necessary.

On the choice of starting with a monolith and then moving to microservices, Martin Fowler, a renowned software developer, suggests that you shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile. 

This recommendation is based on the fact that microservices come with a complexity cost in terms of handling inter-service communication, data consistency, operational complexity, etc. A monolith at the start allows you to move quickly and evolve your application in the early stages when it tends to change a lot.

Once you understand your system's boundaries better and it's becoming clear that certain components of your monolith would benefit from being a separate service (due to reasons like scaling needs, different deployment schedules, or technology stack), that's a good time to consider breaking it up into microservices.

Remember that the purpose of software architecture is to serve your specific needs, so your context and requirements will ultimately guide your decision.

🙋 **You:**

Tell me all the Common services across complex systems if I was doing a GitHub-like website so I can get the most value, operability and revenue for my platform.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Building a platform similar to GitHub would involve implementing several distinct services. Here are some of the most important services that you'd likely need to create:

1. **User Management/Auth Service**: This service would handle user registration, authentication, and profile management. This would include basic functionality for creating and managing user profiles, as well as password resets, email confirmations, and other related tasks.

2. **Repository Service**: The core service of a GitHub-like platform would manage the code repositories. It would handle creating, deleting, and updating repositories, managing access controls, and other tasks related to repository management.

3. **Git Service**: This service would handle the actual Git operations, such as commits, branches, merges, and pull requests. This is a complex service that needs to interact closely with the Repository Service.

4. **Collaboration/Commenting Service**: GitHub is not just about code; it's also about collaboration. This service would handle issues, pull request reviews, and general comments on repositories.

5. **Notification Service**: This service would handle sending notifications to users when certain events happen. This might include email notifications, in-app notifications, and potentially even SMS or other forms of notification.

6. **Search Service**: With potentially millions of repositories and other pieces of content, having a robust search service is crucial. This service should offer full-text search and be able to rank results based on various criteria.

7. **Billing/Payment Service**: If you plan to offer premium features, you'll need a service to handle payments. This might interact with an external payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.

8. **Integration Service**: GitHub integrates with many external tools and services. If you want to offer similar functionality, you'll need a service to manage these integrations.

9. **API Service**: Many of GitHub's features are accessible via an API, allowing third-party applications to interact with the platform. Having an API service would enable similar functionality in your platform.

10. **Security Service**: This service is responsible for security-related tasks like managing permissions, handling two-factor authentication, auditing, and other security-related tasks.

Remember, a good architecture can take you a long way. Starting with a monolithic approach and then breaking down into microservices when needed is usually a good strategy. It's also important to have a good CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process to manage updates and new features. And don't forget to continuously monitor and improve performance as your platform scales.

🙋 **You:**

Now, consider I'll be using Gollum to serve a single sinatra instance for every repo shown. How would that integrate with all those core services?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git that can be used to serve a wiki for each repository. Here is how Gollum could integrate with some of the core services in a GitHub-like system:

1. **Repository Service**: Each repository created through the repository service can have a Gollum instance associated with it. The service can initialize a Gollum wiki whenever a new repository is created. You can also use Git hooks to ensure that the wiki and the main repository stay in sync.

2. **User Management/Auth Service**: The user management service is responsible for managing permissions and access controls. These controls should extend to Gollum instances as well, ensuring that only authorized users can edit or view the wiki for a given repository.

3. **Search Service**: The search service should index the contents of each Gollum instance along with the repository itself. This way, when users search for information, results from the wiki are included.

4. **API Service**: If you are providing an API for third-party applications, the API should also provide endpoints to interact with the Gollum instances. This would allow third-party apps to display or edit wiki content.

5. **Security Service**: The security service should monitor activity on the Gollum instances as well as on the repositories themselves. This includes tracking edits, watching for suspicious activity, and so on.

6. **Notification Service**: Users should receive notifications about changes to the Gollum wikis they're interested in, much like they would for changes to the repositories themselves.

You can run Gollum with a separate Sinatra instance for each repository. You'll need to design your system such that it can manage and route requests to the correct Sinatra instance based on the repository a user is trying to access. 

Be aware that running a separate Sinatra instance for every repository can be resource-intensive if you have a lot of repositories. You'll need to plan your infrastructure to ensure it can scale and handle the load.

In terms of deployment, you may consider using containers (like Docker) for each Gollum instance. This would isolate each wiki and make managing them easier. You could then use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to handle scaling, routing, and lifecycle management for these containers. 

Remember to regularly backup the Gollum wiki data, as it will be a crucial part of each repository. You could handle this as part of the repository service, or create a separate service for backups.

---

🙋 **You:**

Please develop more on the sinatra resource intensive orchestration with docker and kubernetes. How my rails app will generate those individual gollum servers for each user to modify?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Running individual Sinatra servers for each repository can consume substantial system resources, especially as the number of repositories grows. Here's how you could handle this situation using Docker and Kubernetes:

1. **Dockerize Gollum**: First, create a Docker image for the Gollum application. This image should be configured to start Gollum pointed at a Git repository when a container is launched.

2. **Dynamically Launch Containers**: When a user wants to edit a repository's wiki in your Rails application, have the application launch a new Docker container from the Gollum image, pointed at the correct repository. This could be achieved by using the Docker API directly, or by using a library like the Docker SDK for Python or docker-api for Ruby.

3. **Expose Containers**: Each launched Docker container needs to be accessible to the user. This could be accomplished by assigning each container a port on the host machine and then directing the user's browser to that port. Another approach is to set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx) that routes requests based on the URL to the appropriate container.

This basic setup would work but could quickly become unmanageable as the number of repositories (and thus containers) increases. That's where Kubernetes comes in.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that can manage the deployment and scaling of Docker containers. Here's how you could use it in this context:

1. **Deploy Gollum as a Kubernetes Deployment**: Instead of launching Docker containers directly, create a Kubernetes Deployment for each Gollum instance. This Deployment would include a single Pod running the Gollum Docker image, pointed at the correct Git repository.

2. **Expose Deployments with Services**: Each Deployment would then be exposed via a Kubernetes Service. This would give each Gollum instance a stable network interface, even if the underlying Pod is restarted or moved to a different node.

3. **Use Ingress for Routing**: To route user requests to the correct Gollum instance, you could set up a Kubernetes Ingress. This is like a reverse proxy, but it works at the level of the Kubernetes cluster rather than a single machine. The Ingress would route requests based on the URL to the appropriate Service, which would then forward the request to the Gollum Pod.

4. **Scaling**: If you have a lot of users and need to handle a large number of repositories, Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of Pods in a Deployment based on the current load.

5. **Resource Management**: Kubernetes allows you to specify how much CPU and memory each Pod can use. This helps to prevent any one Gollum instance from consuming too many resources and affecting others.

Implementing this setup would require a good understanding of Docker and Kubernetes, as well as how to interact with these systems programmatically from your Rails application. You'd also need a Kubernetes cluster, which could be hosted on a cloud provider like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or self-hosted on your own hardware.

---

🙋 **You:**

Could I integrate all of that with terraform or ansible?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Yes, both Terraform and Ansible are infrastructure as code (IaC) tools that can help manage and automate the setup and deployment of your infrastructure, including Docker and Kubernetes.

Here's how you could use them:

1. **Terraform**: You can use Terraform to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure that your application runs on. For example, if you're using a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, you can use Terraform to create and manage resources such as VM instances, database instances, load balancers, and more. If you're using Kubernetes, Terraform can help set up the Kubernetes cluster itself. Terraform supports a wide range of providers and is especially well-suited for managing cloud resources.

2. **Ansible**: Ansible is primarily a configuration management tool. It excels at ensuring that your servers are in the desired state. For example, it can ensure that the correct software is installed, configuration files are as expected, and services are running. It can also orchestrate more complex operations, such as rolling updates. You could use Ansible to set up Docker and Kubernetes on your servers, install and configure your application, and ensure everything stays up to date.

Both of these tools can be used together in the same system. You could use Terraform to provision the infrastructure and then use Ansible to configure the servers and deploy the application. However, there can be some overlap between the two, and the best tool to use often depends on your specific use case and preferences.

In the context of Docker and Kubernetes, you can use these tools to automate the creation and management of your Docker containers or Kubernetes resources. You could write a Terraform configuration or Ansible playbook that describes your desired state (like running a certain number of Gollum instances), and then run the tool to bring your system into that state. If the state changes (for example, if a Docker container crashes), the tool can detect this and correct it. This can make managing complex systems much easier and more reliable.

How to publish a website with gollum gem?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

To publish a website using the Gollum gem, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Gollum**: Make sure you have the Gollum gem installed on your machine. You can install it using RubyGems:
   ```
   gem install gollum
   ```

2. **Create a Wiki Repository**: Create a new Git repository for your wiki content. Initialize an empty repository or clone an existing one where you want to host your wiki.

3. **Initialize Gollum**: Change to the root directory of your repository and run the following command to initialize Gollum in that directory:
   ```
   gollum
   ```

4. **Edit Wiki Pages**: Gollum will start a local web server and provide you with an address to access the wiki interface in your web browser. By default, it will be something like `http://localhost:4567`. Open that URL in your browser, and you can start creating or editing pages.

5. **Save Changes**: When you save changes in the wiki interface, Gollum will automatically commit those changes to your Git repository.

6. **Push to Remote**: After making changes locally, you can push the changes to your remote Git repository to publish them. For example, if your remote repository is hosted on GitHub, you can use the following commands:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin master
   ```

7. **Host the Repository**: To publish your Gollum wiki as a website, you need to host the Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, which supports serving static content from Git repositories.

8. **Configure Repository Settings**: On the hosting platform, configure your repository settings to enable GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, or similar features. This will allow the platform to automatically generate and serve your Gollum wiki as a website.

9. **Access Your Website**: After setting up the hosting platform, your Gollum wiki will be accessible as a website with a URL like `https://username.github.io/repository/`, where `username` is your username on the hosting platform, and `repository` is the name of your Git repository.

That's it! You now have your Gollum wiki published as a website, and you can continue to edit and update it using the Gollum interface or by making changes to the Git repository and pushing them to the remote.

🙋 **You:**

Does it make sense to create a social network based on gollum?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

While it's technically possible to create a social network using Gollum as the underlying platform, it may not be the most suitable choice for several reasons:

1. **Limited Functionality**: Gollum is primarily designed as a Git-powered wiki engine for creating and editing content. It lacks the built-in features and capabilities required for building a comprehensive social network, such as user profiles, social interactions (like posts, comments, likes), friend requests, messaging, notifications, and more.

2. **Scalability**: Social networks can experience rapid growth in user base and activity. Gollum, being a Git-based system, might not scale well to handle the high level of concurrent users and interactions that a social network typically demands.

3. **User Experience**: Social networks require dynamic, real-time interactions, which are not a core feature of Gollum. Implementing a smooth user experience with real-time updates, interactive feeds, and responsive interfaces could be challenging with Gollum's architecture.

4. **Security and Access Control**: Social networks often require complex access control mechanisms to manage user permissions, privacy settings, and data security. Gollum might not provide the necessary features out of the box.

5. **Customization and Extensibility**: Gollum is more focused on wiki-related functionality and may not offer the level of customization and extensibility required to create unique and feature-rich social network experiences.

If you're interested in creating a social network, it's advisable to explore other platforms and frameworks that are specifically designed for building social networks. There are open-source social network frameworks available that offer a solid foundation for creating such platforms. These frameworks often come with features like user authentication, social interactions, activity feeds, and scalability considerations.

Keep in mind that building a social network is a complex endeavor that involves various technical and design challenges. It's important to evaluate your project requirements, consider the scalability needs, and choose the appropriate technology stack that aligns with your goals and the user experience you want to provide.

---

🙋 **You:**

I am planning to use Rails on top of it but still trying to figure out the best way to do so.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Using Rails on top of Gollum to build a social network could be a more feasible approach. Rails provides a powerful framework for building web applications and can help address some of the limitations of Gollum when it comes to creating dynamic and interactive social network features. Here's a general approach you could consider:

1. **Architecture**: Use Rails as the main application framework to build the social network features, such as user authentication, profiles, posts, comments, likes, and interactions.

2. **Integration with Gollum**: Since Gollum is designed for creating and editing content, you could use it for specific parts of your application, such as user-generated content or documentation. You might integrate Gollum as a separate module within your Rails application, allowing users to create and edit wiki-like content.

3. **User Authentication and Profiles**: Implement user authentication and profile management using Rails' built-in features or popular gems like Devise. This will enable users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

4. **Posts, Comments, and Likes**: Build features like creating posts, adding comments, and liking posts using Rails controllers, models, and views. These features require real-time interaction and updates, which Rails can handle effectively.

5. **Activity Feeds**: Implementing activity feeds that show users' interactions, updates, and posts requires a dynamic system that Rails can provide. You can use gems like PublicActivity to help manage activity feeds.

6. **Real-Time Updates**: For real-time updates and notifications, consider using technologies like WebSockets or Action Cable in Rails to achieve interactive and real-time user experiences.

7. **Scalability**: Plan for scalability by using proper database indexing, caching mechanisms, and optimizing database queries. You might also need to consider using cloud services for hosting and scaling your Rails application as the user base grows.

8. **UI/UX Design**: Design your user interface and user experience to align with the social network concept. Consider using front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to speed up UI development.

9. **Deployment and Infrastructure**: Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration to ensure smoother deployment and scaling of your Rails application and any related services.

10. **Testing and Iteration**: Follow best practices for testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the reliability and quality of your application.

In summary, using Rails on top of Gollum can be a practical approach to build a social network that combines dynamic social features with wiki-like content creation. It allows you to leverage Rails' capabilities to create a more interactive and engaging user experience while still utilizing Gollum for specific content-related functionalities. Just keep in mind that building a social network is a complex project that requires careful planning, development, and continuous improvement based on user feedback.

- So I'd need to have an obsidian rest server running in all my users' machines to sync up with the app? Would that be the best approach? Are there more efficient/secure approaches?
- About the user experience, their profile should link to their own gollum instance, whereas the public side will be the rails public domain of the app, I guess. Their own profiles should help them manage their obsidian seamlessly without having any technical knowledge, so they can always enjoy the managed knowledge base service that our application offers.
- The notes will be always private by default and public only when they have the public: true, or something like that in frontmatter.
- Is there any gem or front end solution to show versions in the web app? Is that within gollum?

🙋 **You:**

I want you to give me an advice that can escalate, about what should be managed by creating new git repos (e.g. workspaces), what should be saved in postgres and what should be managed by frontmatter in md files (and wheter if I'd need to store the yml as config). Your advice should consider security and scalability, mainly.

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Certainly, here's advice on how to manage different aspects of your system using Git repos, PostgreSQL, and frontmatter in MD files, considering security and scalability:

1. **Git Repositories**:
   - **Workspaces**: Consider creating separate Git repositories for each workspace. This allows better organization, version control, and isolation. It's easier to manage access controls, collaborate, and ensure scalability.

2. **PostgreSQL**:
   - **User Profiles**: Store user profile data, authentication details, and high-level metadata in PostgreSQL. This includes information that needs to be accessed frequently and quickly.
   - **Workspace Metadata**: Store workspace metadata (name, description, members) in PostgreSQL. This provides efficient querying and management of workspace information.

3. **Frontmatter in MD Files**:
   - **Note Content**: Store the actual note content and its metadata (title, tags, visibility) in MD files' frontmatter. This keeps the content portable, and Git's versioning is useful for tracking changes.
   - **Note Versioning**: Rely on Git's version control for note versioning. MD files can be committed, and you can retrieve any historical version from the Git history.

4. **YAML Config in MD Files**:
   - **Metadata Configuration**: Use frontmatter YAML for configuration settings that are specific to each note. This might include user-specific settings, custom metadata, or content-specific options.

5. **Security and Scalability Considerations**:
   - **Security**: Implement access controls and encryption mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data stored in PostgreSQL and Git repos. Consider OAuth for user authentication and authorization.
   - **Scalability**: Use distributed Git repositories for scalability in version control. Employ database sharding, indexing, and caching strategies to handle PostgreSQL scalability.

6. **Interaction Between Components**:
   - **Synchronization**: Ensure that interactions between Gollum instances, PostgreSQL, and other components are secure and follow best practices for APIs and data transfer.
   - **API Tokens**: Use API tokens or secure authentication mechanisms to allow components to communicate securely.

7. **Regular Backups**:
   - **Git Repos and Database**: Regularly back up Git repositories and PostgreSQL databases to prevent data loss and facilitate disaster recovery.

8. **Monitor and Scale**:
   - **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track the health and performance of different components. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain insights into system behavior.
   - **Scaling**: As your system grows, plan for horizontal scaling of Git repositories, PostgreSQL clusters, and other components.

Remember, the choice of where to store data depends on factors like data volume, access patterns, security requirements, and performance considerations. Regularly assess and adapt your architecture as your application evolves.

🙋 **You:**

What is the default gollum root page and how can I change it in the server's config?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

The default Gollum root page is the landing page that is displayed when you access your Gollum wiki. By default, Gollum will display a list of all available pages in the root directory of your Gollum repository.

To change the default Gollum root page, you can set up a redirect or custom route in your Gollum server's configuration. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Using `_config.yml`**:
   - Create a `_config.yml` file in the root directory of your Gollum repository if it doesn't exist.
   - Add the following line to the `_config.yml` file to set a custom home page:
     ```yaml
     page_default_dir: path/to/your/custom/root
     ```
   - Replace `path/to/your/custom/root` with the relative path to the directory you want as your new root page.

2. **Using Rack Middleware**:
   - If you're using Gollum with a Rack application, you can define a custom route in your Rack middleware to redirect or render a specific page as your new root page.
   - Modify the Rack application code to include a custom route that points to your desired root page.

3. **Using GitHub-like `README.md`**:
   - If you want to make a specific Markdown file (`README.md`) in your repository the default landing page, you can name it as such. Gollum will display the content of the `README.md` file when you access the repository root.

Remember to restart your Gollum server after making changes to the configuration.

The specific method you choose depends on how you're deploying and configuring your Gollum server. The `_config.yml` approach is typically used for simple configuration changes, while using Rack middleware gives you more flexibility for custom routing and handling.

---

🙋 **You:**

I meant, which is the default md file rendered by gollum server

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Apologies for the misunderstanding. The default Markdown file that Gollum renders when you access the root of your Gollum repository is usually the `Home.md` file. This file serves as the main landing page for your wiki.

If a `Home.md` file exists in the root directory of your Gollum repository, Gollum will automatically render its content when you access the root URL of your Gollum server. If the `Home.md` file doesn't exist, Gollum will typically display a list of available pages and directories.

You can create or modify the `Home.md` file to customize the content displayed on your Gollum wiki's landing page.

---

🙋 **You:**

Can gollum show me the tree of the current git repo? It currently only asks to create a Home.md file

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Yes, Gollum can display the tree of the current Git repository, allowing you to navigate through the directories and files in your repository. By default, Gollum provides a directory listing when there is no `Home.md` file present in the root directory. This directory listing includes links to subdirectories and files within the repository.

If Gollum is asking you to create a `Home.md` file, it's likely because there isn't one in the root directory, and Gollum doesn't have any content to display on the landing page. You can create a `Home.md` file with some content to serve as the main page of your Gollum wiki. Additionally, you can navigate through the repository's directories and files using the links provided in the directory listing.

If you want to display the tree of the Git repository in a more structured manner, you might need to explore Gollum's customization options or extensions, or potentially use a different visualization tool for the repository's tree structure.

---

🙋 **You:**

it doesn't directy listing by default

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

I apologize for any confusion. By default, Gollum doesn't provide a directory listing for the root of the repository if there's no `Home.md` file. Instead, it will show an empty page. If you're seeing a request to create a `Home.md` file, it could be due to your specific Gollum configuration or setup.

If you'd like to customize the behavior of the Gollum root page and provide a directory listing or other content, you can explore the use of custom layouts, themes, or extensions. You might need to modify the Gollum source code or leverage existing plugins to achieve the desired behavior.

Remember that Gollum is designed primarily as a wiki system, so its default behavior may not include a directory listing for the repository's root directory. If you're looking for a more file-focused interface, you might need to consider alternative tools or customize Gollum to match your requirements.

---

🙋 **You:**

I am running it over wsl, could be because of that?

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

Yes, running Gollum over Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) could potentially introduce compatibility issues or configuration differences that might affect how Gollum interacts with your Git repository and Markdown files.

Here are a few things to consider when running Gollum over WSL:

1. **Filesystem Mapping**: WSL maps Windows filesystem paths to Linux paths. Ensure that you're using the correct WSL path when specifying the location of your Git repository and Markdown files in the Gollum configuration.

2. **Permissions**: File permissions and ownership might behave differently in WSL compared to a native Linux environment. Make sure that the user running the Gollum server has the necessary permissions to access and modify the files in the Git repository.

3. **Git Configuration**: Check if there are any differences in Git configurations between your Windows environment and WSL. Gollum relies on Git to access repository contents, so any discrepancies in Git configurations could impact Gollum's behavior.

4. **File Path Formatting**: Be mindful of differences in file path formatting between Windows and Linux. Linux paths are case-sensitive, so ensure that your file references in Markdown files and Gollum's configuration are correctly formatted.

5. **Compatibility**: Some features or behaviors of Gollum might be affected when running in a WSL environment. It's a good idea to consult the Gollum documentation or community forums to see if there are any known issues related to WSL.

6. **Verbose Output**: Run Gollum with the `--verbose` option to see if there are any specific error messages or warnings related to running Gollum in a WSL environment.

7. **Test on Native Linux**: If possible, consider testing Gollum on a native Linux environment (not within WSL) to see if the issue persists. This can help determine whether the problem is specific to the WSL setup.

If you continue to encounter issues while running Gollum over WSL, you might want to explore running Gollum in a native Linux environment (such as a virtual machine or a dedicated Linux system) to see if the behavior changes. Additionally, checking the Gollum documentation and seeking help from the Gollum community might provide insights into any WSL-specific considerations or workarounds.

🙋 **You:**

I just found out it works just after I create a file, until then it won't parse .git folder in the gollum served repo

---

🤖 **Assistant:**

It sounds like Gollum is not immediately recognizing the contents of the `.git` folder in the repository when you first start the server. This behavior might be due to Gollum's internal caching mechanisms, which could affect how it handles the initial scan of the repository.

Here are a few things to consider and steps you can take to address the issue:

1. **Initial Repository Scan**: Gollum performs an initial scan of the repository when it starts. During this scan, it populates its internal cache with information about the repository's structure and contents. If you're creating a new file in the repository, Gollum might not recognize it until it performs a new scan.

2. **Cache Refresh**: After creating a new file or making changes to the repository, try refreshing Gollum's internal cache. You can do this by stopping and restarting the Gollum server. This should trigger a new scan of the repository, and Gollum should recognize the changes.

3. **Manual Cache Clearing**: If simply restarting the Gollum server doesn't work, you can try manually clearing its cache. Gollum stores its cache in a `.gollum-cache` folder in the repository's root directory. You can delete this folder and then restart the Gollum server. Keep in mind that clearing the cache might temporarily impact performance while Gollum rebuilds its cache.

4. **Check Logs**: Check the logs or console output of the Gollum server for any error messages or warnings related to the repository scan. This might provide insights into why Gollum is not recognizing the `.git` folder initially.

5. **Delay on Startup**: If Gollum is not recognizing the `.git` folder immediately after startup, it's possible that there might be a brief delay before the repository scan completes. Give it some time after starting the server to see if it eventually recognizes the contents of the `.git` folder.

6. **Gollum Configuration**: Review your Gollum configuration to ensure that it's pointing to the correct repository path and that any relevant configuration options are set appropriately.

If you continue to experience issues with Gollum not recognizing the contents of the `.git` folder in the repository, consider reaching out to the Gollum community or consulting the Gollum documentation for further assistance. They might be able to provide more specific guidance or solutions based on the behavior you're encountering.
