# "Obsidian NAS Data Management"

## âœ… TODOs


## ðŸ“Œ Summary
I want to use an obsidian knowledge base as the index for all my data under a NAS. Tell me scripts/libraries in any language to cleanup my media (eliminate duplicated data, standardize multiple formats to markdown, index books and academic papers, make backups, name files properly in order to reference them in obsidian wiki links and a tool to sync up those links if any file changes its name or other metadata)

I want to use an obsidian knowledge base as the index for all my data under a NAS. Tell me scripts/libraries in any language to cleanup my media (eliminate duplicated data, standardize multiple formats to markdown, index books and academic papers, make backups, name files properly in order to reference them in obsidian wiki links and a tool to sync up those links if any file changes its name or other metadata)

To achieve your goal of using Obsidian as the index for your data under a NAS and perform various tasks like media cleanup, file standardization, indexing books and academic papers, backups, proper file naming for referencing in Obsidian, and syncing up links, you can utilize a combination of scripting languages and tools. Here are some suggestions:

1. Python: Python is a versatile scripting language that can help you automate various tasks related to data processing and file management.

   - For duplicate file removal: You can use libraries like `filecmp` or `dhash` to compare files and remove duplicates. You can iterate over the files, calculate hash values, and remove duplicates based on those hashes.
   
   - For file format standardization to Markdown: Depending on the specific file formats you want to convert, you can use libraries like `pandoc` or `python-markdown` to convert files to Markdown format.

   - For indexing books and academic papers: You can use libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six` to extract text from PDFs and process it for indexing. You can also use libraries like `pdf2image` to convert PDFs to images for indexing if needed.

   - For file backup: You can use the `shutil` library to create backups by copying or moving files to a designated backup directory.

   - For proper file naming: You can use regular expressions (`re` module) to extract relevant information from filenames and rename them accordingly. Alternatively, you can use libraries like `pyrename` or `os.rename` to handle file renaming.

   - For syncing Obsidian links: You can use a combination of file monitoring tools like `watchdog` and regular expression matching to detect changes in filenames or metadata. When changes occur, you can update the corresponding Obsidian links accordingly.

2. Bash scripting: Bash scripting can be used for various file management tasks and can be easily integrated into your workflow.

   - For duplicate file removal: You can use tools like `fdupes` or `rdfind` to identify and remove duplicate files.

   - For file format standardization to Markdown: You can use command-line tools like `pandoc` to convert files to Markdown format.

   - For indexing books and academic papers: You can use command-line tools like `pdftotext` or `pdfimages` to extract text or images from PDFs for indexing purposes.

   - For file backup: You can use `rsync` or `cp` commands to create backups of your files.

   - For proper file naming: You can use commands like `mv` or `rename` to rename files based on specific patterns or rules.

   - For syncing Obsidian links: You can combine bash scripting with tools like `inotifywait` to monitor file changes and trigger updates to Obsidian links.

3. Obsidian API: Obsidian provides an API that allows you to interact with your Obsidian vault programmatically. You can use this API to create custom scripts or tools to perform tasks like syncing links, updating metadata, or performing searches. You can use any programming language that supports HTTP requests to utilize the Obsidian API.

   - To sync Obsidian links: You can write a script in your preferred programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) to interact with the Obsidian API. The script can periodically scan your files, detect changes, and update the corresponding links in your Obsidian vault.

Note: The specific implementation details will depend on your exact requirements and the structure of your data. You may need to combine multiple scripts or tools to achieve a comprehensive solution.

Similar scripts functionality but with rust. Iâ€™ll say continue and then same ask but with ruby

Sure! Here's how you can achieve similar functionality using Rust and Ruby:

Rust:
1. For duplicate file removal: You can use the `walkdir` and `hashbrown` crates to recursively iterate over files, calculate hashes, and remove duplicates based on those hashes.

2. For file format standardization to Markdown: You can use the `pandoc` command-line tool by invoking it using the `std::process` module.

3. For indexing books and academic papers: You can use the `pdf-extract` crate to extract text from PDFs or the `image` crate to convert PDFs to images for indexing.

4. For file backup: You can use the `fs_extra` crate to create backups by copying or moving files to a designated backup directory.

5. For proper file naming: You can use the `regex` crate to extract relevant information from filenames and rename them accordingly using the `std::fs` module.

6. For syncing Obsidian links: You can use the `notify` crate to monitor file changes and update the corresponding Obsidian links.

Ruby:
1. For duplicate file removal: You can use the `find_duplicates` gem to identify and remove duplicate files based on hash values.

2. For file format standardization to Markdown: You can use the `pandoc-ruby` gem to convert files to Markdown format.

3. For indexing books and academic papers: You can use the `pdf-reader` gem to extract text from PDFs and process it for indexing. You can also use tools like `imagemagick` to convert PDFs to images for indexing if needed.

4. For file backup: You can use the `fileutils` module in Ruby's standard library to create backups by copying or moving files to a designated backup directory.

5. For proper file naming: You can use regular expressions (`Regexp` class) to extract relevant information from filenames and rename them accordingly using the `File` class in Ruby's standard library.

6. For syncing Obsidian links: You can use the `listen` gem to monitor file changes and update the corresponding Obsidian links.

Please note that the examples provided above are general guidelines, and you may need to explore the specific documentation and usage examples for each language, library, or tool to adapt them to your specific requirements.
