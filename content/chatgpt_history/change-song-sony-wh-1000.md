ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To change the song on your Sony WH-1000 series headphones, you can use the touch controls located on the right earcup. Here's how:

### Skip to the Next Song
- Swipe **forward** on the touchpad of the right earcup.

### Go Back to the Previous Song
- Swipe **backward** on the touchpad of the right earcup.

### Adjust Volume (Optional)
- Swipe **up** to increase the volume.
- Swipe **down** to decrease the volume.

These gestures should work if the touch controls are enabled and functioning correctly. If they don't seem to work:
1. **Check Settings in the Sony Headphones Connect App**: Ensure touch controls are enabled.
2. **Reset the Headphones**: If the touch controls are unresponsive, reset the headphones.
