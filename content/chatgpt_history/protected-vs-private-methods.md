Ruby Junior Prep:
Difference between private and protected

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

In Ruby, both `private` and `protected` are access control mechanisms that help in encapsulating the methods within a class, making them accessible only from within the class or its subclasses. However, there are nuanced differences in how they operate and in their accessibility from outside the class or within the class hierarchy. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### Private Methods

- **Accessibility:** Private methods in Ruby can only be called without an explicit receiver. This means you can only call these methods from within the same object. Trying to call a private method with an explicit receiver, even if it's `self`, will result in an error.
- **Use Case:** Private methods are typically used for internal utility functions within a class, where there is no need for them to be accessible to any other part of the program.
- **Inheritance:** Private methods are inherited by subclasses and remain private in the subclass.

### Protected Methods

- **Accessibility:** Protected methods are accessible from within the class and any of its subclasses, but with a key difference: they can be called with an explicit receiver as long as the receiver is an instance of the same class or a subclass. This means you can use `self` or any other instance of the class (or its subclasses) to call a protected method.
- **Use Case:** Protected methods are useful when you need to allow instances of a class (or its subclasses) to interact with each other in ways that are not allowed for outside objects. For instance, when implementing a method that compares two objects of the same class.
- **Inheritance:** Like private methods, protected methods are inherited by subclasses and remain protected in the subclass.

### Example Illustration

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(age)
    @age = age
  end

  def older_than?(other_person)
    age > other_person.age
  end

  protected

  def age
    @age
  end
end

person1 = Person.new(30)
person2 = Person.new(20)

puts person1.older_than?(person2)  # => true
puts person1.age  # This will raise an error: NoMethodError
```

In this example, `older_than?` is a public method that compares the ages of two `Person` objects. The `age` method is protected, so it can be called by `older_than?` on `other_person` (since `other_person` is an instance of `Person`). However, attempting to call `person1.age` directly from outside the class will raise an error because it's protected.

This demonstrates the key use case for protected methods: enabling controlled visibility between objects of the same class or subclasses, which isn't possible with private methods without a workaround.

time-space complexity

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. Let's break down both concepts:

### Time Complexity

Time complexity measures the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. It's usually expressed as a function of the size of the input (n), using Big O notation to describe the upper limit of the runtime in the worst-case scenario. This helps in understanding how the execution time changes as the input size increases.

- **Constant Time (O(1))**: The execution time remains constant regardless of the input size.
- **Logarithmic Time (O(log n))**: The execution time grows logarithmically as the input size increases. Binary search is a classic example.
- **Linear Time (O(n))**: The execution time grows linearly with the input size. For example, iterating through an array.
- **Linearithmic Time (O(n log n))**: The execution time grows in proportion to n log n. Many efficient sorting algorithms, like mergesort and quicksort, fall into this category.
- **Quadratic Time (O(n^2))**: The execution time grows quadratically with the input size. Algorithms with nested loops over the input data, such as bubble sort, have quadratic time complexity.
- **Cubic Time (O(n^3))** and higher polynomials: The execution time grows cubically (or worse) with the input size. These are generally inefficient for large input sizes.
- **Exponential Time (O(2^n))**: The execution time doubles with each addition to the input data set. Algorithms that generate all subsets of a set fall into this category.
- **Factorial Time (O(n!))**: The execution time grows factorially with the input size, seen in algorithms that generate all permutations of a set.

### Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. Like time complexity, it's often expressed using Big O notation relative to the size of the input.

- **Constant Space (O(1))**: The amount of memory used does not change with the size of the input data.
- **Linear Space (O(n))**: The amount of memory used grows linearly with the input size. For example, storing all elements of an array.

It's important to note that both time and space complexity are theoretical measures. They help us understand and compare the efficiency of algorithms but do not provide exact runtimes or memory usage. Optimizing for time often requires more space, and vice versa, leading to trade-offs based on the constraints of a given problem.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! Let's provide some code examples to illustrate the concepts of time and space complexity with common algorithms or operations in Python. These examples will demonstrate how the complexity affects both the time it takes to run the algorithm and the amount of memory it uses.

### 1. Linear Time Complexity (O(n)) and Constant Space Complexity (O(1))

**Finding the maximum value in an array** demonstrates linear time complexity because it requires scanning each element of the array once.

```python
def find_max(nums):
    max_val = nums[0]  # Assume the first number is the max initially
    for num in nums[1:]:

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! Let's provide code samples in Ruby that illustrate some common algorithms and their time-space complexity. Each example will include a brief explanation of what the code does, along with its time and space complexity.

### 1. Linear Search (Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1))

Linear search iterates through an array to find a target value. It checks each element one by one.

```ruby
def linear_search(array, target)
  array.each_with_index do |item, index|
    return index if item == target
  end
  nil
end

array = [5, 3, 2, 8, 6]
target = 8
puts linear_search(array, target) # Output: 3
```

### 2. Binary Search (Time Complexity: O(log n), Space Complexity: O(1))

Binary search finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

```ruby
def binary_search(array, target)
  low = 0
  high = array.length - 1

  while low <= high
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    guess = array[mid]
    return mid if guess == target
    if guess > target
      high = mid - 1
    else
      low = mid + 1
    end
  end

  nil
end

array = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
target = 10
puts binary_search(array, target) # Output: 3
```

### 3. Bubble Sort (Time Complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(1))

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

```ruby
def bubble_sort(array)
  n = array.length
  loop do
    swapped = false
    (n-1).times do |i|
      if array[i] > array[i+1]
        array[i], array[i+1] = array[i+1], array[i]
        swapped = true
      end
    end
    break unless swapped
  end
  array
end

array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
puts bubble_sort(array).inspect # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

### 4. Fibonacci Series (Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n))

This example calculates the Fibonacci series up to `n` numbers, storing the series in an array. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

```ruby
def fibonacci(n)
  fib = [0, 1]
  (2..n).each do |i|
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
  end
  fib[0..n]
end

n = 5
puts fibonacci(n).inspect # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

These examples demonstrate a range of algorithms with different time and space complexities, showcasing the efficiency and application of each algorithm in Ruby.
