What is the most efficient way to centralize all my pdfs so I can access them from many locations and have their metadata properly organized and easily modifiable?

Consider using a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox to centralize your PDFs. These platforms allow easy access from multiple locations and often support metadata editing. Additionally, you can use dedicated document management tools like Mendeley or Zotero for more advanced organization and metadata capabilities.

I am a Ruby on Rails / js / Linux / python programmer.

Great! For centralizing and organizing PDFs, you might want to explore tools that align with your programming skills. Consider building a custom solution using Ruby on Rails for the backend, JavaScript for the frontend, and utilize a cloud storage API (like Google Drive API or Dropbox API) to manage PDFs. Linux can be your hosting environment, and you can leverage Python scripts for any additional automation or data processing needs.

I want to be able to search within the pdfs

To enable searching within PDFs, you can integrate a full-text search engine into your application. Elasticsearch is a powerful choice and can work well with your tech stack. You'll need to extract text content from PDFs, index it in Elasticsearch, and then implement a search functionality in your application using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. There are also libraries like PDFMiner or PyPDF2 in Python that can help with text extraction from PDFs.

And keep track of my readings so I can jump back to specific point in them. Iâ€™d love to have metrics of how much Iâ€™ve been reading, like in Books app in iOS

For tracking your readings and implementing metrics, consider incorporating a user-specific system where you record reading progress and timestamps. In your Ruby on Rails application, you can create a model to store details like the PDF, current page, and timestamp. Use JavaScript for a smooth frontend experience, updating these details as users navigate through PDFs.

To display reading metrics, calculate and present statistics based on the stored data. You can utilize charting libraries like Chart.js for visual representation. This way, you'll have a personalized reading tracking system similar to the Books app in iOS.

Wrap everything together and provide a technical advice,include libraries/gems/etc and proposed implementation

Certainly! Here's a high-level technical advice for implementing your PDF management system:

**1. Backend (Ruby on Rails):**
   - Use Ruby on Rails for the backend.
   - Utilize the Paperclip or Active Storage gem for handling PDF uploads to your server.

**2. PDF Text Extraction (Python):**
   - Use Python with PDFMiner or PyPDF2 to extract text content from PDFs. You can create a Python script that the Rails backend calls when a PDF is uploaded.

**3. Full-Text Search (Elasticsearch):**
   - Integrate Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities. Use the `elasticsearch-model` and `elasticsearch-rails` gems to interact with Elasticsearch from your Rails application.

**4. Frontend (JavaScript):**
   - Employ JavaScript (possibly with a framework like Vue.js or React) for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
   - Implement a smooth reading experience, allowing users to navigate PDFs and record their progress.

**5. User Reading Progress (Database Model):**
   - Create a model in Rails to store user-specific reading progress, including details like the PDF, current page, and timestamp.

**6. Metrics and Visualization (Chart.js):**
   - Utilize Chart.js to display reading metrics and statistics.
   - Calculate and present metrics like total reading time, most frequently accessed documents, etc., based on the stored reading progress data.

**7. Cloud Storage Integration:**
   - Integrate Google Drive or Dropbox API for cloud storage. Use the `google_drive` or `dropbox_api` gems to interact with these services from your Rails application.

**8. Automation (Sidekiq):**
   - Consider using Sidekiq for background processing to handle tasks like PDF text extraction asynchronously.

**9. Authentication and Authorization (Devise, CanCanCan):**
   - Implement user authentication using Devise and manage authorization with CanCanCan.

**10. Deployment (Linux):**
   - Deploy your application on a Linux server. Tools like Capistrano can be handy for deployment.

Remember to thoroughly test your application and ensure proper error handling. Regularly update dependencies for security and performance improvements. This setup provides a comprehensive solution for managing, searching, and tracking your PDF readings.

So there are libraries or gems I can use to display the pdf in my web interface to keep track of it or I would have to listen to the browser pdf reader?

You can use a JavaScript PDF viewer library to display PDFs directly within your web interface, allowing you to keep track of user interactions. One popular choice is PDF.js, a Mozilla project that provides a robust and customizable PDF viewer entirely in JavaScript.

To integrate PDF.js into your Rails application:

1. Include PDF.js in your project. You can either download it or include it via CDN.
2. Create a dedicated view in your Rails application to render the PDF viewer.
3. Use JavaScript to interact with PDF.js, allowing users to navigate and read PDFs seamlessly.

This approach empowers you to track user interactions and reading progress within your web interface. Remember to handle PDF uploads and connections with your backend to synchronize user progress and reading data.

How about using Calibre or Zotero?

Both Calibre and Zotero are excellent tools for managing and organizing your digital library, including PDFs. While they might not directly replace the need for a custom web application, they can complement your workflow in certain aspects.

1. **Calibre:**
   - **Strengths:**
      - Robust e-book management, including PDFs.
      - Offers metadata management and searching capabilities.
      - Has a built-in viewer for various e-book formats.
   - **Considerations:**
      - Primarily designed for e-books, may not have advanced features for tracking reading progress or integration with web interfaces.

2. **Zotero:**
   - **Strengths:**
      - Designed for academic research with excellent reference management.
      - Manages PDFs and extracts metadata.
      - Integrates with web browsers for easy capturing of online content.
   - **Considerations:**
      - While great for research, Zotero may not provide a custom web interface for tracking reading progress as you mentioned.

**Integration:**
   - You can use Zotero for reference management and metadata extraction.
   - For reading progress tracking and a customized web interface, consider building a separate application using the outlined technical advice.

Ultimately, combining tools like Calibre or Zotero for library management with a custom web application for tracking reading progress and providing a personalized interface might offer a comprehensive solution tailored to your needs.
