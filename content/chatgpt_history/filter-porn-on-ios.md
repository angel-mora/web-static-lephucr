Antiporn filter for iPhone iPad

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To set up an anti-porn filter on an iPhone or iPad, you can use the built-in features provided by iOS to control and restrict content that can be accessed on the device. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to enable these settings:

1. **Go to Settings**: Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.

2. **Screen Time**: Navigate to "Screen Time". If you haven't already turned on Screen Time, you'll need to do so by following the prompts.

3. **Content & Privacy Restrictions**: Tap on "Content & Privacy Restrictions". You may need to enable this by toggling it on at the top of the screen.

4. **Content Restrictions**: Select "Content Restrictions", then tap on "Web Content".

5. **Limit Adult Websites**: Choose "Limit Adult Websites" under Web Content. This will automatically restrict access to many adult websites. You can also add specific websites to the "Always Allow" or "Never Allow" lists to customize the restrictions.

6. **Customize Controls**: For additional customization, you can adjust other settings under the Content & Privacy Restrictions menu to control things like apps, movies, TV shows, and other types of content based on age ratings.

These settings will help filter out adult content and provide a safer, more controlled browsing experience on your iPhone or iPad. Remember to use a passcode for Screen Time that is different from your device's unlock passcode to prevent bypassing the restrictions.
