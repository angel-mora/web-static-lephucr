ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To access files on your Android device using the Brave browser, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Open Brave Browser**: Launch the Brave browser on your Android device.

2. **Navigate to the File**: You can access local files directly by using the `file://` protocol in the browser's address bar. For example, typing `file:///sdcard/` will open the internal storage directory of your device, where you can browse through folders and files. 

3. **Viewing Files**: Once you navigate to the folder where your file is located, click on the file to open it. Brave can open various file types like images, PDFs, and text files directly in the browser. However, for some file types, you may need an appropriate app to view them.

4. **Downloading Files**: If you want to download a file from the internet, you can do so by navigating to the web page containing the file, clicking on the download link, and following the prompts to save the file to your device.

5. **Access Restrictions**: Keep in mind that due to security reasons, some versions of Android and certain browser settings might restrict access to certain files or directories.

6. **Using a File Manager for More Control**: If you need more comprehensive access to your files, using a dedicated file manager app might be a better option. These apps are designed to provide easier navigation and management of files on your device.

Remember that the exact steps can vary depending on the version of Android and Brave browser you are using. If you encounter any issues, checking Brave's support resources or the help section for your device's version of Android can be helpful.

Tell me a UI that helps manage files. What sort of contents would it have? Consider it would be something like a filesystem assistant that helps you deal with markdown based notes and all your media (photos, video, etc) managed over markdown config files. I presume it would have colored folders for most visited, it would show recently opened files, it would show  a calendar. Tell me what kind of things it would need to be useful for programmer to unify the management of their computers
