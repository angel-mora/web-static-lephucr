How to monitor multiple wifi routers remotely for my family and my company?

Monitoring multiple WiFi routers remotely involves a combination of hardware and software tools:

1. **VPN**: Setup a VPN so you can access your company/family network securely from anywhere. 

2. **Remote Management**: Enable remote management on your routers. This allows you to log into your routers via the internet. Be very careful with this feature as it can be a security risk if not properly secured.

3. **Network Monitoring Tools**: Use network monitoring tools like Nagios, PRTG Network Monitor, or SolarWinds. These tools allow you to monitor network devices, bandwidth, and traffic. They often come with mobile apps or web interfaces so you can check on things remotely.

4. **Cloud-Based Management**: Some modern routers come with cloud-based management tools that you can access from anywhere via a web browser or a mobile app.

5. **Security**: Ensure all the devices and routers have strong passwords, and secure the network with a firewall and other security tools.

Note: Some of these steps require technical knowledge about networks, routers, and security. If you are not comfortable doing it yourself, consider hiring a professional or consult your company's IT department.

So provide a tutorial and tell me instructions to do it

Setting up remote monitoring for multiple WiFi routers is a complex task that involves several steps. Here's a basic tutorial to get you started:

1. **Setup a VPN**

    Setting up a VPN is essential for securely accessing your network remotely.

    - Choose a VPN provider and sign up for a service.
    - Install the VPN software on your devices.
    - Configure the VPN on your router. This step varies depending on your router model, so consult your router's manual or the VPN provider's instructions.

2. **Enable Remote Management**

    Enabling remote management allows you to access your router's settings from anywhere.

    - Open your router's settings by typing its IP address into a web browser.
    - Find the remote management settings. This is often under 'Advanced Settings' or 'Administration'.
    - Enable remote management and set a strong password.

    Note: Be very careful with this feature as it can be a security risk if not properly secured.

3. **Install Network Monitoring Tools**

    Network monitoring tools like Nagios, PRTG Network Monitor, or SolarWinds can help you monitor your network.

    - Choose a network monitoring tool and download it.
    - Install the software on a computer that is always on and connected to your network.
    - Configure the software to monitor your routers and other network devices.

4. **Setup Cloud-Based Management**

    If your router supports cloud-based management, this can be an easier way to monitor your network remotely.

    - Open your router's settings and find the cloud-based management section.
    - Create an account and configure your router to use cloud-based management.

5. **Secure Your Network**

    Ensuring your network is secure is crucial.

    - Set strong passwords for all your devices and routers.
    - Enable a firewall on your router and configure it to block unwanted traffic.
    - Regularly update your router's firmware and other network devices.

Note: This is a basic tutorial and may not cover all the specific details for your particular setup. It's always a good idea to consult a professional or your company's IT department if you are not comfortable doing it yourself. Additionally, make sure to test your setup thoroughly to ensure it is working correctly and securely.
