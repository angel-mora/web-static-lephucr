# SQL Query for Contact's URL

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

search a url in body column of table contacts, provide sql query

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Assuming the table name is "contacts" and the column name is "body" and you are searching for the URL "www.example.com", you can use the following SQL query:

```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE body LIKE '%www.example.com%'
```

This query will select all rows from the "contacts" table where the "body" column contains the string "www.example.com" anywhere in the text. The % signs are wildcards that match any character before or after the specified string.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

can a email be routed to another email address?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, an email can be routed to another email address through email forwarding. Email forwarding is a feature provided by email services and clients that allows you to automatically forward incoming emails to another email address. This can be useful in situations where you want to receive emails in one email account, but also want to have a copy of those emails forwarded to another email account for backup or convenience.

To set up email forwarding, you usually need to go to the settings or options section of your email service or client and look for the forwarding options. You will typically need to enter the email address to which you want to forward the emails and configure any other settings, such as whether to keep a copy of the forwarded email in the original account or not.

It's worth noting that some email services and clients may have limitations on email forwarding, such as only allowing forwarding to certain email domains or limiting the number of emails that can be forwarded.

Share a query to update that email matched

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Sure, here's an example of an SQL query to update an email record in a table called `users` where the email address matches a specified value:

```
UPDATE users
SET email = 'new_email@example.com'
WHERE email = 'old_email@example.com';
```

In this example, the query updates the `email` field of the `users` table and sets it to the new value `'new_email@example.com'` for all records where the `email` field matches the old value `'old_email@example.com'`.

You can customize this query by replacing `users` with the name of the table you want to update, and `'new_email@example.com'` and `'old_email@example.com'` with the appropriate email addresses you want to update.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Share a query to update that email matched from the previous query

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Assuming that you have already executed the previous query and found the email(s) that you want to update, and that you want to update the email address to "new_email@example.com", you can use the following SQL query to update the email address in the "contacts" table:

```
UPDATE contacts SET email = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE body LIKE '%www.example.com%' AND email = 'old_email@example.com';
```

This query uses the same WHERE clause as the previous query to match the rows that contain the email address you want to update, and then sets the value of the "email" column to the new email address.

Note that you may need to modify the column and table names in the query to match the structure of your database, and you should be careful when updating data in a database, as incorrect updates can result in data loss or corruption.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

The tricky part is that the email matched in the body is within an html content

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If the email you want to update is located within an HTML content within the `body` column of the `contacts` table, you can use the following SQL query to update the email address:

```
UPDATE contacts SET body = REPLACE(body, 'old_email@example.com', 'new_email@example.com') WHERE body LIKE '%www.example.com%';
```

This query uses the `REPLACE` function to replace all occurrences of the old email address with the new email address in the `body` column for all rows that match the search criteria specified in the WHERE clause.

Note that this query assumes that the old email address is located within an HTML anchor tag (i.e., `<a>` tag), as this is a common scenario when email addresses are embedded in HTML content. If the email address is located in a different type of HTML element, such as a paragraph tag (`<p>`), then you will need to modify the query accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that if the `body` column contains a large amount of data, this query may take some time to execute.
