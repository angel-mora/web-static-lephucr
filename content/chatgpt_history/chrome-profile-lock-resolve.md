[5726:5726:0717/122417.718213:ERROR:process_singleton_posix.cc(353)] The profile appears to be in use by another Google Chrome process (7065) on another computer (U-4WH6ASLDUVZU).  Chrome has locked the profile so that it doesn't get corrupted.  If you are sure no other processes are using this profile, you can unlock the profile and relaunch Chrome.

It appears that Google Chrome is detecting another instance of the browser using the same profile on a different computer or process. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Ensure No Other Instances Are Running:**
   - Make sure that no other instances of Google Chrome are running on any other computer or process that might be using the same profile. Close any open instances of Chrome.

2. **Unlock the Profile:**
   - If you are certain no other instances are using the profile, you can manually delete the `Lock` file that Chrome uses to prevent multiple processes from using the same profile. Here's how:
     - Locate your Chrome user data directory. This is usually found at:
       - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data`
       - **macOS:** `/Users/<Your Username>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome`
       - **Linux:** `~/.config/google-chrome`
     - In the user data directory, find the `Default` folder or the folder corresponding to the profile you are using.
     - Inside this folder, delete the `Lock` file.

3. **Restart Chrome:**
   - After deleting the `Lock` file, try restarting Google Chrome.

4. **Check for Background Processes:**
   - Sometimes, Chrome processes might still be running in the background. Ensure all Chrome processes are closed:
     - **Windows:** Use Task Manager to end all Chrome-related processes.
     - **macOS:** Use Activity Monitor to end all Chrome-related processes.
     - **Linux:** Use `ps aux | grep chrome` to find and kill all Chrome-related processes.

If the issue persists, consider restarting your computer to ensure all processes are properly terminated.
