It's important to take steps to protect your personal data in case your phone is lost or stolen. Here are some strategies you can use to split your data between your Android and iPhone:

1. Separate your banking apps: Since you have two different banking accounts, it's a good idea to use one banking app on your Android phone and the other banking app on your iPhone. This will help you minimize the risk of someone gaining access to both of your accounts if they steal one of your phones.

2. Use different passwords: It's important to use unique and strong passwords for each of your accounts, including your banking apps and password manager. Make sure to use different passwords for each account and never reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

3. Use two-factor authentication: Enable two-factor authentication for all your accounts that support it. This will add an extra layer of security and make it harder for hackers to gain access to your accounts.

4. Secure your iPhone's Face ID: If you're concerned about the security of Face ID, you can disable it and use a passcode instead. To do this, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn off the toggle for Face ID.

5. Use different messaging apps: Since you have two different phone numbers, it's a good idea to use a different messaging app for each phone. You can use Telegram on your Android phone and WhatsApp on your iPhone, for example. This will help you keep your conversations and contacts separate between the two phones.

6. Use different email accounts: Similar to messaging apps, use different email accounts on each phone. This will help you keep your emails separate and reduce the risk of someone gaining access to both email accounts if one of your phones is stolen.

By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of being scammed if your phone is lost or stolen. Remember to regularly back up your data and keep your software up to date to ensure maximum security.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To save your Obsidian template configuration from your desktop to your mobile device, you can follow these steps:

1. Export your Obsidian template configuration from your desktop: In Obsidian on your desktop, go to Settings > Plugins > Templates, and click on the gear icon next to "Templates". From there, select "Export templates" and save the file to your computer.

2. Transfer the file to your mobile device: You can transfer the file to your mobile device in a variety of ways, such as using a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive, sending it to yourself via email, or transferring it via USB.

3. Import the template configuration on your mobile device: Once you have the file on your mobile device, open Obsidian and go to Settings > Plugins > Templates. Click on the gear icon next to "Templates" and select "Import templates". Navigate to the file you transferred from your desktop and select it. The template configuration will now be imported into your Obsidian installation on your mobile device.

Note that any changes you make to your template configuration on your mobile device will not be automatically synced back to your desktop. If you want to keep the configurations in sync between your devices, you will need to repeat this process in reverse to export the template configuration from your mobile device and import it into Obsidian on your desktop.
