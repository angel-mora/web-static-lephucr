🤖 **Assistant:**

The issue of duplicated tags in Kanban cards when using the Obsidian Things theme or similar setups appears to be related to settings within the Kanban plugin itself rather than a specific bug with the theme. One solution offered by users is to enable the option to "hide tags in card titles" within the Kanban plugin's settings. Activating this setting can hide the first (uncolored) tag, potentially resolving the duplication issue by only displaying the colored tag or the intended single instance of a tag【5†source】.

Another related issue mentioned the duplication of dates and tags, which was resolved by toggling options within the plugin preferences such as "Hide dates in card titles" and "Hide tags in card titles." These settings effectively removed the duplicated elements from display【6†source】.

Additionally, there was a concern about the Kanban page displaying the default theme instead of the selected theme (Things theme, in this context). The recommendation here was to check for any conflicting CSS snippets and ensure that the default Kanban settings were not enabled in the style settings plugin for the Things theme【7†source】.

These solutions imply that the problem can often be resolved through careful review and adjustment of the Kanban plugin's settings, ensuring they align with the user's thematic preferences and specific display requirements. If you're experiencing similar issues, reviewing the plugin's settings as described may provide a resolution.
