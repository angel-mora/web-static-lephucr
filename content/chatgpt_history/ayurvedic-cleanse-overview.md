2. **Diet**: Non-fat diet of kitchari (mung beans and rice) to support detoxification.
3. **Herbs**: Ayurvedic herbs are used to enhance detox pathways.
4. **Hydration and Stress Relief**: Daily hydration protocols and stress-relieving practices are essential.

This cleanse is gentle and designed for those without serious medical issues.
