Transferring data from your Huawei P30 Pro to an iPhone or a Mac can be done in a few different ways depending on the type of data you want to transfer. Here are some options:

### Option 1: Using Huawei Phone Clone (App Gallery)

   - Wait for the transfer to complete.

### Option 2: Using Google Services (Play Store)

If your data is synced with Google services (like contacts, calendar, etc.), you can easily set up your iPhone or Mac to sync with your Google account:

1. **Sync Google Account on iPhone:**
   - On your iPhone, go to Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account.
   - Choose Google and sign in with your Google account credentials.

### Option 3: Transferring Specific Data

For photos and videos, you can use apps like Google Photos or Dropbox to upload them from your Huawei P30 Pro and then download them on your iPhone or Mac.

### Option 4: Manual Transfer via USB or iCloud

For specific files like music or documents, you can connect your Huawei P30 Pro to your Mac via USB and manually transfer files. Alternatively, use iCloud to sync data between your iPhone and Mac.

### Considerations:
- **App Data:** Not all apps and their data may transfer seamlessly between Android and iOS.

   - Wait for the transfer process to complete. The time required depends on the amount of data.

### Step 2: Use Google Services for Additional Data

For data like contacts, calendar events, and emails synced with Google services, ensure your Google account is set up on your iPhone:

1. **Sync Google Account on iPhone:**
   - Go to Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account.
   - Choose Google and sign in with your Google account credentials.
   - Enable syncing for contacts, calendars, and other data types.

### Step 3: Manual Transfer for Specific Data

   - Use Google Photos or a similar cloud service to upload from Huawei and then download to your iPhone.
   
2. **Music and Documents:**
   - Connect your Huawei P30 Pro to your Mac via USB and manually transfer files to your Mac.
   - Use iCloud Drive or other cloud storage services to upload from your Mac and download to your iPhone.

### Considerations:
