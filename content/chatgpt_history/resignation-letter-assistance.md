**[Supervisor's Name]**

**Dear [Supervisor's Name],**  

I am writing to formally resign from my position at [Company Name], effective [last working day, typically two weeks from the date of this letter].  

Over the past months, I have realized that I havenâ€™t been feeling as well as Iâ€™d like. After much reflection, I believe itâ€™s necessary to take a pause to focus on rest and recuperation. This decision was not an easy one to make, as I deeply value my time at [Company Name] and the opportunities Iâ€™ve had to grow and contribute.  

I am incredibly grateful for the support, mentorship, and camaraderie Iâ€™ve experienced during my time here. Working alongside such a talented and passionate team has been a privilege, and I will always look back fondly on the memories and lessons Iâ€™ve gained.  

In the coming weeks, I will do my best to ensure a smooth transition by wrapping up ongoing tasks and assisting with the handover process. Please let me know if thereâ€™s anything specific I can do to support the team during this period.  

Thank you once again for everything. I hope to cross paths with [Company Name] and its wonderful people again in the future.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]
