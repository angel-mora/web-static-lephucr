How an index for a column works? Does it reindex every some time ? I'm working in rails

An index for a column in a database, such as one you might use in a Rails application, functions as a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index. Most database systems support indexes, and they work by essentially keeping a separate structure that points back to the main table but is organized in a way that makes searches efficient.

### How Does an Index Work?

When you create an index on a column, the database system builds a data structure (typically a B-tree or hash table) that holds the values of the indexed column and a reference to the corresponding row in the table. This allows the database to find rows matching a condition quickly without scanning the entire table. For example, if you have an index on the `user_id` column of an `orders` table, the database can quickly locate all orders for a specific user by looking up the user's ID in the index.

### Does It Reindex Automatically?

The process of maintaining the index (adding, updating, or deleting entries) happens automatically as data in the indexed table changes:

- **Inserts:** When a new row is inserted, the database adds an entry to the index for the indexed column(s).
- **Updates:** When a value in an indexed column is updated, the database modifies the corresponding entry in the index.
- **Deletes:** When a row is deleted, the database removes the corresponding entry from the index.

This means that the index is kept up-to-date with the table data automatically, ensuring that queries using the index are fast. However, because the index must be updated whenever the data changes, this can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the table.

### Rebuilding or Reorganizing Indexes

In some cases, indexes can become fragmented, especially after a large number of updates and deletes. This fragmentation can degrade performance. Database administrators sometimes manually rebuild or reorganize indexes to improve performance. This is not specific to Rails but is a consideration for the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

### Usage in Rails

In Rails, you can add an index to a column using migrations. Here's a simple example of adding an index to the `user_id` column on the `orders` table:

```ruby
class AddIndexToOrdersUserId < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_index :orders, :user_id
  end
end
```

Rails abstracts many of the complexities of interacting with database indexes, but it's still important to understand how they work at the database level, especially for performance tuning and when dealing with large datasets.

### Conclusion

Indexes are a powerful feature for optimizing database queries, but they come with trade-offs in terms of write performance and disk space usage. Rails, through Active Record, provides a straightforward way to manage indexes, but understanding how they work under the hood can help you make better decisions about when and how to use them.
