# XPath Abstraction in Capybara

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

find('//*[@id="edit_company_520"]/div[2]/div[5]/div[1]/div[13]/div[1]/div/input[2]').click
abstract this xpath in capybara to generic company id

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To abstract the given XPath in Capybara for a more generic company ID, you would want to create a method that allows you to specify the company ID as a parameter. The original XPath seems quite specific and brittle, as it's heavily dependent on the structure of the HTML. A more robust solution would be to use identifiable attributes like IDs, classes, or data attributes that are more closely tied to the specific elements you're trying to interact with.

Here is an example of how you might abstract this XPath to make it more adaptable and less brittle:

```ruby
def click_company_edit_button(company_id)
  xpath = "//div[@id='edit_company_#{company_id}']//input[@type='button'][2]"
  find(:xpath, xpath).click
end
```

In this function, `click_company_edit_button`, you replace the hardcoded `520` with `#{company_id}`, which allows you to pass any company ID as an argument. The XPath now dynamically changes based on the company ID you provide. This makes your test more flexible and easier to maintain.

You would use this function in your tests like so:

```ruby
click_company_edit_button(520)  # Replace 520 with the desired company ID
```

Remember, this approach assumes that the structure of your HTML is consistent across different companies. If the structure varies significantly, you might need a more complex strategy or different identifiers to ensure reliability.
