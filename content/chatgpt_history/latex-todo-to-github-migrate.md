What is the easiest way to move a bunch of TODOs from LaTeX \todo library to simple GitHub issues

One possible way to move a bunch of TODOs from LaTeX \todo library to GitHub issues is:

1. Copy the contents of the LaTeX \todo library into a text editor.
2. Use a regular expression or find-and-replace functionality to remove any LaTeX-specific syntax and leave only the text of the TODOs.
3. Copy the resulting plain text into a new document or spreadsheet.
4. Format the plain text as a table with columns for issue title, description, and any relevant metadata such as due date or priority.
5. Save the table as a CSV file.
6. Open your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Issues" tab.
7. Click on the "Import issues" button and select the CSV file you just created.
8. Map the columns in the CSV file to the corresponding fields in the GitHub issue tracker.
9. Review the imported issues and make any necessary edits or adjustments.

By following these steps, you should be able to efficiently migrate your TODOs from LaTeX \todo library to GitHub issues, which can help you keep better track of your project tasks and progress.

Provide the regular expression, replace the word text with any matching string content:
\todo{text}

To remove the LaTeX-specific syntax and leave only the text of the TODOs, you can use the following regular expression:

```
\\todo\{(.+?)\}
```

This regular expression matches the entire `\todo{}` command and captures the content of the curly braces, which is the text of the TODO.

To replace the matched text with any string content, you can use the replacement pattern `$1` to preserve the captured text, like so:

```
$1
```

So the final find-and-replace command would look like this:

Find: `\\todo\{(.+?)\}`
Replace: `$1`

How can I make vscode search to copy to clipboard the matching lines

You can use the built-in search functionality in Visual Studio Code to copy matching lines to the clipboard by following these steps:

1. Open the file or folder you want to search in.
2. Open the search panel by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + F` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Shift + F` on macOS.
3. Enter the search query in the search box.
4. In the search panel, click on the "..." button and select "Copy All Matches" from the dropdown menu.
5. The matching lines will be copied to the clipboard.

Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to copy the matching lines to the clipboard:

- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + L` to select all occurrences of the search query, then `Ctrl + C` to copy the selected lines.
- macOS: `Cmd + Shift + L` to select all occurrences of the search query, then `Cmd + C` to copy the selected lines.

Note that the keyboard shortcuts will select all occurrences of the search query in the current document, while the "Copy All Matches" option in the search panel will copy all matches in all files that match the search query in the current folder or workspace.
