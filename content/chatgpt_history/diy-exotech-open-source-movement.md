DIY open source technologies to build exo scheleton

DIY open-source technologies for building exoskeletons are an emerging area of interest for hobbyists, researchers, and engineers alike. Exoskeletons, which are wearable devices that work in tandem with the user, can augment human capabilities by providing additional strength, endurance, and support. Here's an overview of some key components and resources you might explore if you're interested in developing your own open-source exoskeleton:

### 1. Microcontrollers and Electronics
- **Arduino**: Widely used in DIY projects, Arduino boards can serve as the brain of your exoskeleton, controlling motors and sensors.
- **Raspberry Pi**: For more complex tasks that require computing power, like processing sensor data or implementing AI, a Raspberry Pi can be integrated.

### 2. Actuators and Motors
- **Electric Motors**: Commonly used for movement, electric motors can be controlled by your microcontroller to provide the necessary force.
- **Pneumatic or Hydraulic Systems**: For more power, pneumatic (air) or hydraulic (fluid) systems can be used, though they are more complex to implement.

### 3. Sensors
- **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)**: To track movement and orientation, IMUs are crucial. They can help with balance and control.
- **Force Sensors**: To detect the amount of force being applied and adjust the exoskeleton's response accordingly.

### 4. Software and Algorithms
- **Open-source Robotics Software**: Platforms like ROS (Robot Operating System) can be instrumental in developing the software needed for an exoskeleton.
- **Custom Code**: Depending on your project's complexity, you might write custom software to control the hardware, using languages like Python, C++, or Java.

### 5. Mechanical Components
- **3D Printed Parts**: Many exoskeleton projects utilize 3D printing for custom-fitted parts that are lightweight and strong.
- **Off-the-Shelf Components**: Using gears, belts, and bearings from the market can significantly reduce development time.

### 6. Online Communities and Resources
- **GitHub**: A treasure trove of open-source projects, including some related to exoskeletons. You can find software, designs, and valuable insights here.
- **Instructables and Hackaday**: Websites with DIY projects, where enthusiasts share their builds, including exoskeletons, with step-by-step guides.
- **Research Papers and Publications**: Exploring academic and industry research can provide insights into advanced materials, designs, and control strategies.

### 7. Safety Considerations
When building an exoskeleton, it's crucial to consider safety. This includes ensuring the device can't exert harmful force on the user, has emergency stop mechanisms, and doesn't restrict natural movements in a dangerous way.

Building a DIY exoskeleton is a complex project that requires interdisciplinary knowledge, including mechanics, electronics, and software engineering. It's also a field where innovation can have profound implications, not just for enhancing human capabilities but also for rehabilitation and assisting those with mobility issues.

Provide e-stores to buy all required components and then a list of most items for a exoskeleton to integrate people with bycicles. Dont forget to mention if there are similar projects (and their urls) 

Building an exoskeleton for bicycling involves integrating technology that can assist with pedaling, enhance endurance, or support the rider's posture and safety. To source the components necessary for such a project, several e-stores are pivotal for acquiring electronics, mechanical parts, and other materials. Here's a breakdown of where to buy these components and a list of most items you'll need for an exoskeleton aimed at integrating with bicycles. I'll also mention similar projects for reference.
