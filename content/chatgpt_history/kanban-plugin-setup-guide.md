What things should I have in my obsidian kanban plugin markdown file so it's fully clear for freelancers I'll hire over Fiverr

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Creating a clear and effective Kanban board in your Obsidian markdown file for managing freelancers you hire over platforms like Fiverr can greatly improve project communication, expectations, and overall workflow. Here's a comprehensive guide to setting up your Kanban board:

### 1. **Project Overview Section**
- **Project Name**: Clearly state the project's name or title.
- **Project Description**: Offer a brief overview of what the project entails.
- **Goals and Objectives**: Detail what you hope to achieve with the project.
- **Timeline**: Provide deadlines or important dates.
- **Budget Overview**: If applicable, outline the budget constraints.

### 2. **Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Project Manager**: Your contact details as the project manager.
- **Freelancers' Details**: Names and roles of the freelancers involved (you might need to update this regularly).
- **Points of Contact**: Include details for primary communication (email, messaging platforms, etc.).

### 3. **Task Management**
This is the core of your Kanban board, consisting of several columns to track the progress of tasks:

- **To Do**: List all tasks that need to be started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Review**: Tasks that have been submitted and await your review.
- **Revisions**: Tasks that need further work based on your feedback.
- **Completed**: Tasks that are finished and approved.

### 4. **Task Details**
Each task card should include:

- **Task Title**: A clear, descriptive title.
- **Description**: Detailed information about what the task entails.
- **Deliverables**: What you expect to receive upon completion.
- **Deadline**: When the task should be completed.
- **Assigned To**: The freelancer responsible for the task.
- **Priority Level**: Indicate if it's High, Medium, or Low priority.

### 5. **Communication Protocol**
- **Preferred Communication Channels**: Specify how you wish to communicate (e.g., email, Slack).
- **Update Frequency**: How often you expect updates on progress.
- **Feedback Loop**: Process for giving and receiving feedback.

### 6. **Resources**
- **Project Files**: Links to any files or documents the freelancers might need.
- **Tools and Software**: Any specific tools required to complete the tasks.
- **References**: Links or documents for inspiration or guidance.

### 7. **Policies and Procedures**
- **Revisions Policy**: Outline how many revisions are included and how they are handled.
- **Payment Schedule**: Detail when payments will be released (e.g., upon completion, milestones).
- **Confidentiality Agreement**: Highlight if any non-disclosure agreement is in place.

### 8. **FAQ Section**
Include answers to commonly asked questions to reduce back-and-forth communication.

### 9. **Feedback and Suggestions**
Encourage freelancers to provide feedback on the project process for continuous improvement.

### Implementing Your Kanban Board
- Use tags to make searching through tasks easier.
- Consider color coding for different phases, priorities, or freelancers.
- Regularly update the board to reflect current progress and changes.

This structure will help keep your projects organized and ensure that all freelancers have the information they need to succeed. Adjustments might be necessary based on specific project requirements or preferences.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

What things I should be careful of if I want to make it open source?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Making your Obsidian Kanban plugin setup or any project open source is a fantastic way to contribute to the community, encourage collaboration, and improve the project with contributions from others. However, there are several important considerations to keep in mind to ensure a smooth transition to open source and to manage the project effectively thereafter:

### 1. **Choose an Appropriate License**
- **Legal Protection**: Licenses such as MIT, GPL, and Apache offer varying levels of protection and openness. Decide how you want your project to be used and select a license that matches those intentions.
- **Contributions**: Understand how contributions will be licensed. Some licenses may require derivatives or contributions to also be open source.

### 2. **Clean and Document Your Code**
- **Readability**: Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to coding standards. This makes it easier for others to understand and contribute.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for setup, usage, and contribution guidelines. This includes a README file, contributing guidelines, and a code of conduct.

### 3. **Define Contribution Guidelines**
- **Contribution Process**: Make it clear how others can contribute. Include guidelines for submitting issues, pull requests, and coding standards.
- **Community Guidelines**: Establish rules for how community members should interact to maintain a positive and productive environment.

### 4. **Consider Privacy and Security**
- **Sensitive Data**: Ensure no sensitive data (

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly, here's a concise summary of the advice for setting up your Obsidian Kanban plugin for freelancers and making your project open source:

### Obsidian Kanban Setup for Freelancers (YML Format)
Your markdown file can be structured into sections outlined in a YAML-like format for clarity:

```yaml
Project_Overview:
  Project_Name: ""
  Project_Description: ""
  Goals_and_Objectives: ""
  Timeline: ""
  Budget_Overview: ""

Roles_and_Responsibilities:
  Project_Manager: ""
  Freelancers_Details: []
  Points_of_Contact: ""

Task_Management:
  Columns: [To Do, In Progress, Review, Revisions, Completed]

Task_Details:
  - Task_Title: ""
    Description: ""
    Deliverables: ""
    Deadline: ""
    Assigned_To: ""
    Priority_Level: ""

  References: []

Policies_and_Procedures:
  Revisions_Policy: ""

```

### Making Project Open Source (Keywords)

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

provide the yml that should be in the card only, and then tell me which of the rest items in the yml shared above that are not in the card are attributes of the project definition itself

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Here's a YAML snippet that represents what might be included in an individual card for a task within your Obsidian Kanban board:

```yaml
Task_Details:
  Task_Title: "Design Logo"
  Description: "Create a logo that aligns with our brand guidelines."
  Deliverables: "Logo in SVG and PNG formats."
  Deadline: "2024-04-20"
  Assigned_To: "Freelancer Name"
  Priority_Level: "High"
```

The attributes in this YAML snippet are specific to individual tasks or "cards" within your Kanban board. These details help define what is expected for each task, who is responsible, and by when it should be completed.

### Attributes Not in the Card (Project Definition Attributes)

The following attributes from the initially shared YAML structure are not specific to individual cards but are instead attributes of the project definition itself. They describe broader project information, guidelines for communication, and general policies rather than task-specific details:

- **Project_Overview**: Contains general information about the project including its name, description, objectives, timeline, and budget overview. These set the stage for the entire project's goals and limits.
  
- **Roles_and_Responsibilities**: Details the project manager, freelancers' details (which could be dynamic), and points of contact. This section is about defining who is involved and their roles in the project.
  
- **Communication_Protocol**: Outlines how communication should be handled within the project, including preferred channels, update frequency, and the feedback loop. This ensures everyone knows how and when to communicate.
  
- **Resources**: Lists any project files, tools, software, and references needed to complete the tasks. This is critical for ensuring freelancers have what they need to work effectively.
  
- **Policies_and_Procedures**: Defines the revisions policy, payment schedule, and confidentiality agreement. These are essential for setting expectations on revisions, payments, and privacy.
  
- **FAQ_Section**: A helpful addition for addressing common questions, reducing the need for direct inquiries about repetitive issues.
  
- **Feedback_and_Suggestions**: Encourages ongoing improvement through feedback from freelancers about the project process.

These project definition attributes provide a framework and necessary details to guide the overall project management and collaboration process, distinct from the task-specific details that are included on individual Kanban cards.
