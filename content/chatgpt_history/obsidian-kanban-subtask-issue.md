I am showing you a desktop and a mobile view of the same obsidian kanban file, one in mac and one in iphone. Why it doesn't display substasks in iPhone? I will also provide the markdown. I will upload files from devices and only when I'm done you reply, ok?



Got it! Go ahead and upload the files from both devices, and let me know when you're done. I'll analyze them and provide an answer.

I see the desktop version. Now please upload the iPhone version so I can compare them.

{"content_type"=>"image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer"=>"file-service://file-HYJ8HXYTKbR54LA1dpmfoE", "size_bytes"=>152420, "width"=>1536, "height"=>708, "fovea"=>nil, "metadata"=>{"dalle"=>nil, "gizmo"=>nil, "generation"=>nil, "container_pixel_height"=>nil, "container_pixel_width"=>nil, "emu_omit_glimpse_image"=>nil, "emu_patches_override"=>nil, "sanitized"=>true, "asset_pointer_link"=>nil}}





I can see both the desktop and iPhone versions now. What specific issue are you facing between the two? Are there layout inconsistencies, missing elements, or functionality differences? Let me know so I can help troubleshoot.

The mobile version won’t show the subtasks 

It looks like you're using a Kanban-style project management tool (possibly Notion or another similar app). If subtasks aren’t showing in the mobile version but are visible on desktop, here are a few things to check and try:

### 1. **Expand the Task**
   - Tap on the task card to open it fully. Some mobile versions hide subtasks inside the task details.

### 2. **Check if Subtasks Are Nested Correctly**
   - On desktop, ensure your subtasks are properly nested within the main task rather than as separate cards.

### 3. **Enable All Views**
   - Some mobile apps have limited views compared to desktop. Check if you're in a "Simple View" and switch to a "Detailed" or "Expanded" view.

### 4. **Try Using a Toggle or Expand Option**
   - If there’s a small arrow or expand button next to a task, tap it to reveal subtasks.

### 5. **Check for Sync Issues**
   - If the subtasks were recently added on desktop, try refreshing the app or logging out and back in on mobile.

### 6. **Update the App**
   - Ensure you’re using the latest version of the app, as UI inconsistencies are sometimes fixed in updates.

Let me know if any of these work or if you'd like a more app-specific solution!

Using Obsidian and Obsidian Sync 

Since you're using **Obsidian** with **Obsidian Sync**, here are some things to check and try to get your subtasks to show properly on mobile:

### **1. Check Formatting of Subtasks**
Obsidian recognizes subtasks when using **Markdown checklists**:
```markdown
- [ ] Main Task
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
```
On mobile, indentation can sometimes break. Ensure the subtasks are properly indented using **two spaces** before the dash (`-`).

### **2. Check the Mobile View Mode**
- Open the note on **Obsidian Mobile**.
- Tap the three-dot menu (`•••`) in the top-right corner.
- Switch between **Reading Mode** and **Editing Mode** to see if subtasks appear correctly.

### **3. Verify Sync Status**
- Go to **Settings → Sync** and ensure sync is completed on both devices.
- If not, manually **force sync** on both desktop and mobile.

### **4. Test in a New Note**
- Create a new note with a simple checklist structure.
- Check if it renders properly on mobile.

### **5. Check Plugins (If Using Kanban)**
If you're using the **Obsidian Kanban Plugin**, subtasks may not be visible in the default card view. Try:
- Opening the **card details** on mobile.
- Switching to **Markdown mode** to check if subtasks are listed.

### **6. Ensure Kanban Plugin is Enabled on Mobile**
- Go to **Settings → Community Plugins**.
- Ensure **Kanban** is installed and enabled on **both** desktop and mobile.

Let me know if any of these steps help!

Compared them and think iPhone version can’t show sublists for some reason. Browse a similar bug in Obsidian forums 

I understand that you're experiencing an issue where subtasks (nested lists) are not displaying correctly on your iPhone in Obsidian. This problem can arise due to differences in how nested lists are rendered between the desktop and mobile versions of Obsidian.

**Potential Cause:**

Inconsistent indentation can lead to nested lists not rendering properly. For instance, using a tab character for indentation might work on the desktop but not on mobile. It's recommended to use spaces for indentation to ensure consistency across devices.

**Solution:**

1. **Use Spaces for Indentation:**
   - Replace any tab characters with spaces. Typically, two spaces are used for each level of nesting.
   - Ensure that all nested list items are consistently indented using spaces.

2. **Check in Both Editing and Reading Modes:**
   - Switch between editing and reading modes on your iPhone to see if the issue persists in both.

3. **Update Obsidian:**
   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of Obsidian on both your Mac and iPhone, as updates often address rendering inconsistencies.

For more detailed discussions on similar issues, you can refer to this thread on the Obsidian Forum:

- [Nested Lists - Basic Question](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/nested-lists-basic-question/18420)

This thread discusses issues related to nested lists and provides insights that might be helpful in resolving your problem.

If after trying these steps the issue persists, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further. 

Awesome, thanks a bunch!!

You're very welcome! Glad I could help. If you run into any other Obsidian quirks or need more troubleshooting, feel free to ask. Happy organizing!
