Hey, what chriteria would you use to create obsidian wiki links within a bunch of markdown files?
Tell me what I should do (having the ruby gpt gem) and what would you do (what is your semantic chriteria, how you are trained to solve this issues of detecting a common concept based on context)?

As an AI language model, I am trained to understand natural language text and identify meaningful relationships between concepts. In the context of creating Obsidian wiki links within a bunch of markdown files, my approach would be to identify the relevant concepts based on the content of the files and create links accordingly.

To achieve this, you can use the Ruby GPT gem to analyze the text and identify the relevant concepts based on the semantic criteria you define. Here's an approach you can take:

1. Define your semantic criteria: Before you start creating links, you need to decide what criteria you will use to identify relevant concepts. For example, you may want to look for capitalized words or phrases that appear frequently across multiple files, or you may want to identify specific keywords related to a particular topic.

2. Parse the markdown files: Use the Ruby GPT gem to read in the markdown files and parse the text.

3. Identify relevant concepts: Using the semantic criteria you defined, scan the parsed text to identify the relevant concepts. You may need to use natural language processing techniques to identify synonyms and related terms.

4. Create links: Once you have identified the relevant concepts, create Obsidian wiki links to other files or sections within the same file that contain information related to those concepts. You can use the Ruby GPT gem to programmatically generate the links.

As an AI language model, I don't have any specific semantic criteria for creating Obsidian wiki links within markdown files. However, I can help you develop a custom solution based on your specific needs and requirements.

How do you understand a contextualized concept within some text?

As an AI language model, my understanding of contextualized concepts within text is based on the statistical patterns and relationships I have learned from analyzing vast amounts of language data.

When processing text, I use a technique called contextualized word embeddings to map each word to a high-dimensional vector that captures its meaning based on the surrounding context. This means that each word's embedding is influenced by the other words in the sentence, paragraph, or document it appears in.

These embeddings can be used to identify words or phrases that are semantically related to each other, even if they don't share a common spelling or stem. For example, the words "dog" and "puppy" may have very different embeddings, but they are likely to be located close to each other in the embedding space because they are often used in similar contexts.

To understand a contextualized concept within some text, I analyze the embeddings of the words and phrases surrounding the concept, taking into account the context in which it appears. This allows me to identify the relationships between different concepts and build a more comprehensive understanding of the overall meaning of the text.

For example, if the text mentions the concept of "programming languages," I can analyze the embeddings of the surrounding words and phrases to identify related concepts such as "computer science," "syntax," "compiler," "interpreter," etc. By identifying these related concepts, I can develop a more nuanced understanding of what the text is discussing and how it fits into the larger context of computer programming.

Can you provide some literature and code projects in the internet about "contextualized word embeddings"? 

Sure, here are some resources that you may find helpful for learning about contextualized word embeddings and code projects related to them:

1. "Contextualized Word Representations: A Contextual Introduction" by Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of contextualized word embeddings and their applications in natural language processing (NLP): https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365.

2. "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. This paper introduces BERT, one of the most widely used models for contextualized word embeddings: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805.

3. "Hugging Face Transformers" is a popular open-source library for implementing contextualized word embeddings and other NLP models: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.

4. "ELMo: Deep contextualized word representations" by Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, H. Andrew Schwartz, and Christopher Clark. This paper introduces ELMo, an earlier model for contextualized word embeddings: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365.

5. "Flair: A Framework for State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing" is another open-source library that provides pre-trained contextualized word embeddings and other NLP models: https://github.com/flairNLP/flair.

6. "pytorch-transformers" is a PyTorch implementation of BERT and other related models: https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers.

These resources should provide a good starting point for learning about contextualized word embeddings and their applications in NLP, as well as some code projects that you can explore and experiment with.

How can  I create a note with timestamp from a template?

To create a note with a timestamp from a template, you can use a scripting language like Python or a command-line tool like Bash. Here's a step-by-step guide using Python:

1. Create your template file:
   Start by creating a template file with placeholders for the timestamp or any other dynamic content you want to include. For example, your template file (template.md) could look like this:

```
# Meeting Notes - {{timestamp}}

**Attendees:** {{attendees}}

**Agenda:**
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

2. Write a Python script to generate the note with a timestamp:

```python
import datetime
import shutil

# Read the template file
with open('template.md', 'r') as file:
    template_content = file.read()

# Replace the placeholders with dynamic content
timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
attendees = "John, Jane, Bob"  # Replace this with the actual list of attendees

note_content = template_content.replace('{{timestamp}}', timestamp).replace('{{attendees}}', attendees)

# Save the note with the timestamp
note_filename = f'meeting_notes_{timestamp.replace(" ", "_").replace(":", "")}.md'

with open(note_filename, 'w') as note_file:
    note_file.write(note_content)

print(f'Note "{note_filename}" created successfully.')
```

3. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script in the same directory as your template.md file and run it. The script will read the template file, replace the placeholders with the current timestamp and attendees, and save the generated note as a new markdown file with the timestamp in its name.

Remember to modify the `attendees` variable with the actual list of attendees you want to include in your note.

You can execute this script whenever you need to create a new note with a timestamp based on your template.

in obsidian

To create a note with a timestamp from a template in Obsidian, you can use the Templater plugin. Here's how to do it:

1. Install the Templater plugin:
   In Obsidian, go to `Settings > Community Plugins`, search for "Templater," and install the plugin.

2. Create your template file:
   Start by creating a template file with placeholders for the timestamp or any other dynamic content you want to include. For example, create a new note named `template.md` with the following content:

```
# Meeting Notes - {date:YYYY-MM-DD}

**Attendees:** {attendees}

**Agenda:**
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

3. Configure the Templater plugin:
   Go to `Settings > Templater` and set up the template path to the location where your `template.md` file is stored. For example, if your template is stored in the root folder of your Obsidian vault, you can set the template path to `/template.md`.

4. Use Templater to create notes with timestamps:
   Now, whenever you want to create a new note based on the template with the current timestamp, use the following syntax in the Obsidian editor:

```markdown
{!template.md}
```

After typing this line, the Templater plugin will automatically replace the placeholders `{date:YYYY-MM-DD}` with the current date in the specified format and prompt you to fill in the `{attendees}` placeholder.

5. Save the note:
   Fill in the relevant details, such as the attendees, and save the note. Obsidian will create a new note based on the template, and the placeholders will be replaced with the current timestamp and the information you entered.

The Templater plugin in Obsidian allows you to automate the process of generating notes from templates, saving you time and ensuring consistent formatting across your notes.

Can it include hour of the day?

Yes, the Templater plugin in Obsidian can include the hour of the day in the timestamp. To include the hour in the timestamp, you need to modify the template and use the appropriate date format placeholder. Here's how you can do it:

1. Modify the template file (template.md):
   Update the template file to include the hour of the day in the timestamp. You can use the `{date}` placeholder with the desired format for the date and time. For example, to include the date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss," update your template as follows:

```markdown
# Meeting Notes - {date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss}

**Attendees:** {attendees}

**Agenda:**
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

2. Use Templater to create notes with timestamps:
   Now, whenever you want to create a new note based on the template with the current timestamp (including the hour), use the following syntax in the Obsidian editor:

```markdown
{!template.md}
```

After typing this line, the Templater plugin will automatically replace the `{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss}` placeholder with the current date and time in the specified format and prompt you to fill in the `{attendees}` placeholder.

3. Save the note:
   Fill in the relevant details, such as the attendees, and save the note. Obsidian will create a new note based on the template, and the placeholders will be replaced with the current timestamp (including the hour of the day) and the information you entered.

With this modification, your notes created from the template will now include both the date and the hour of the day in the specified format.

where should i input {!template.md}?

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The `{!template.md}` syntax is not the correct way to trigger the Templater plugin in Obsidian.

In Obsidian, you can use the Templater plugin by adding a code block in your note. Here's the correct way to include the template and trigger the Templater plugin:

1. Create your template file (template.md):
   As described earlier, create a template file with placeholders for the timestamp and any other dynamic content you want to include.

2. Modify the template to include the hour of the day:
   Update the template file (template.md) to include the hour of the day in the timestamp using the desired date format placeholder, as shown in the previous response.

3. In your note, add a code block with the Templater trigger:
   To create a new note based on the template with the current timestamp (including the hour), open or create a new note where you want to use the template. Add a code block in the note with the following syntax:

```markdown
```templater
template: template.md
```
```

4. Save the note:
   After adding the Templater code block, save the note. Obsidian will recognize the Templater trigger and generate a new note based on the template. The placeholders in the template will be replaced with the current timestamp (including the hour) and any other dynamic content you specify.

Remember to fill in the `{attendees}` placeholder within the Templater code block when prompted to complete the note content.

By following these steps, you can use the Templater plugin to create a new note with a timestamp from your template, including the hour of the day as desired.

Most popular dataviewjs queries for knowledge bases. Can be existing or good ideas to improve productivity

DataViewJS is a powerful plugin for Obsidian that allows you to query and manipulate data in your knowledge base. Here are some popular and productivity-enhancing DataViewJS queries for knowledge bases:

1. Word Count and Character Count:
   ```
   TABLE file, wc(file.content) as "Word Count", len(file.content) as "Character Count" SORT by "Word Count" desc
   ```
   This query creates a table with files, their word count, and character count. Sorting the table by word count in descending order helps you identify the longest notes or those with the most content.

2. Daily Notes with Word Count:
   ```
   LIST from #daily_notes, wc(file.content) as "Word Count" WHERE date(file.name) >= date(now())-P7D
   ```
   This query lists your daily notes from the last 7 days and includes their respective word counts. It can help you track your daily writing productivity.

3. Tags and Their Usage:
   ```
   TABLE file.tag, COUNT(file.tag) as "Tag Count" SORT by "Tag Count" desc
   ```
   This query generates a table showing all tags used in your knowledge base and their respective usage counts. Sorting by tag count allows you to identify the most frequently used tags.

4. Notes Linked to a Specific Note:
   ```
   LIST from [[Note Title]] 
   ```
   Replace `Note Title` with the title of the note you want to find incoming links for. This query lists all the notes that link to the specified note. It helps you identify the backlinks and connections between notes.

5. File Size and Modification Date:
   ```
   TABLE file, size(file.path) as "File Size", modified(file.path) as "Last Modified" SORT by "File Size" desc
   ```
   This query creates a table with file names, their sizes, and the date they were last modified. Sorting by file size in descending order helps you find large files that might need to be optimized.

6. Todos and their Completion Status:
   ```
   TABLE file, COUNT(file.todo.completed) as "Completed Todos", COUNT(file.todo) as "Total Todos" SORT by "Completed Todos" desc
   ```
   This query generates a table with files, the number of completed and total todos within those files. Sorting by completed todos helps you identify notes with completed tasks.

7. Daily Word Count Trend:
   ```
   LINEAR from #daily_notes, daily(file.name) as "Date", sum(wc(file.content)) as "Word Count" GROUP by "Date" SORT by "Date"
   ```
   This query creates a line chart showing the daily word count trend from your daily notes. It helps you visualize your writing productivity over time.

These queries are just a starting point, and you can customize them to suit your specific needs and knowledge base structure. DataViewJS offers a wide range of possibilities to explore and analyze your data effectively.
