is there anything like a mix of ENDGAME and Nicolas Jaar?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

That's an intriguing combination! ENDGAME and Nicolas Jaar both explore experimental sounds, but in distinct ways. If you're looking for music that blends ENDGAME's raw, industrial beats with Nicolas Jaar's atmospheric and deeply layered electronic compositions, you might enjoy:

1. **Arca** - Arca's music fuses experimental electronic, deconstructed club sounds, and emotional depth, often creating an immersive, otherworldly atmosphere.
2. **Oneohtrix Point Never** - Known for his blend of glitch, ambient, and electronic experimentation, Oneohtrix Point Never has a unique sound that can feel both chaotic and serene, reminiscent of Jaar's atmospheres but with a harsher edge.
3. **Lotic** - Lotic's music is a powerful mix of industrial, experimental club music with emotive undertones, similar to what you'd get if you combined the soundscapes of ENDGAME with Nicolas Jaar's explorations.
4. **Zuli** - This Egyptian artist blends glitch, bass-heavy beats, and experimental sounds, offering something that's both rhythmic and texturally rich.

These artists combine elements of dark, experimental club music with a more atmospheric and introspective vibe, akin to the mix you're seeking.
