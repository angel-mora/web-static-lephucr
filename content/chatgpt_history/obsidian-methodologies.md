Title of the conversation: Obsidian Methodologies
Tell me all the Obsidian methodologies you know, separating them by use cases. E.g. for Obsidian as a PKM use Tiago Forte's PARA method.

As an AI developed by OpenAI, my training only extends up to September 2021. As of my last training data, I can share the following methodologies commonly used with Obsidian. Keep in mind that these methodologies are not exclusive to Obsidian but can be adapted for use in various PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) systems. 

1. **PKM - Personal Knowledge Management**
   - *Tiago Forte's PARA method*: The PARA method stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. It's a universal system for organizing digital information. Projects are current objectives with a deadline, Areas are ongoing parts of your life that you need to maintain over time, Resources are topics of ongoing interest, and Archives contain inactive items from the other three categories.
   - *Zettelkasten method*: A Zettelkasten is a method of note-taking and personal knowledge management used in research. The word Zettelkasten means "slip box" in German. Each "Zettel" or note in the system is designed to be connected with other notes to create a web of information. This helps users see and think about the relationships between different ideas.

2. **Research & Academic Studies**
   - *Luhmann's Zettelkasten*: Luhmann's Zettelkasten method is a more specific iteration of the Zettelkasten method that was used by the sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It involves creating a "communication partner" out of your Zettelkasten by creating extensive links and references between notes.
   - *Literature notes and permanent notes*: This is a method used in academic studies where notes taken while reading (literature notes) are synthesized and transformed into permanent notes, which capture insights in your own words and are integrated into your existing note system with links and connections.

3. **Writing & Content Creation**
   - *Atomic notes method*: This method involves breaking down your notes into the smallest meaningful units (or "atoms") and then linking these notes together. This can be especially useful for writers and content creators who can then combine these "atoms" of information in different ways to create new content.

4. **Task and Project Management**
   - *GTD (Getting Things Done) in Obsidian*: GTD is a productivity system developed by David Allen. While not specific to Obsidian, it can be used in Obsidian to manage tasks and projects. In this methodology, tasks are captured, clarified, organized, reflected upon, and engaged with in a systematic manner.

5. **Learning & Study**
   - *Feynman Technique*: This technique involves explaining a concept in your own words, as if you were teaching it to someone else. By doing this, you can uncover gaps in your understanding and deepen your grasp of a topic. Obsidian's linking and backlinking functionality can be useful for this, allowing you to see how different concepts relate to one another.

Remember that the value in these methodologies comes from customizing and combining them to fit your needs. As new methodologies may have emerged since my last update, I recommend checking the Obsidian forums or other resources for the most recent information.

Now, provide a tutorial for each of the methodologies grouped by use cases. Make sure to show a file tree and an explanation of the workflow.

Sure, let's break this down for each use case. I'll provide a simplified tutorial for the main methodologies in each category.

1. **PKM - Personal Knowledge Management**

    - *Tiago Forte's PARA method*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Projects
                - Project 1
                - Project 2
            - Areas
                - Area 1
                - Area 2
            - Resources
                - Resource 1
                - Resource 2
            - Archives
                - Archive 1
                - Archive 2
            ```
        - *Workflow*: Organize your notes based on Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. Move them around as needed, e.g., when a project is finished, it can be moved to Archives.

    - *Zettelkasten method*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Zettelkasten
                - 20230710 Note 1
                - 20230711 Note 2
                - 20230712 Note 3
            ```
        - *Workflow*: Each note is given a unique identifier, often the date and time, and links are created between notes to form a knowledge graph. This encourages emergent understanding and serendipitous connections.

2. **Research & Academic Studies**

    - *Luhmann's Zettelkasten*
        - *File Structure*: Similar to the Zettelkasten method, with an added emphasis on linking and referencing notes. Each note should reference others to create a rich, interconnected web.
        - *Workflow*: Create a "communication partner" by actively linking notes to each other, facilitating cross-referencing and emergent understanding.

    - *Literature notes and permanent notes*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Literature Notes
                - Book 1
                - Article 1
            - Permanent Notes
                - Note 1
                - Note 2
            ```
        - *Workflow*: After reading, create literature notes capturing the main ideas. Then, transform these into permanent notes, written in your own words and linked to other relevant notes.

3. **Writing & Content Creation**

    - *Atomic notes method*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Atomic Notes
                - Note 1
                - Note 2
                - Note 3
            ```
        - *Workflow*: Each note should represent a single idea or piece of information. Notes are then linked together to form larger, interconnected ideas.

4. **Task and Project Management**

    - *GTD (Getting Things Done) in Obsidian*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Inbox
            - Next Actions
            - Waiting For
            - Projects
            - Someday/Maybe
            ```
        - *Workflow*: Tasks are first captured in the Inbox. They are then clarified, organized into the appropriate category, reflected upon, and engaged with according to the GTD method.

5. **Learning & Study**

    - *Feynman Technique*
        - *File Structure*: 
            ```
            - Feynman Notes
                - Concept 1
                - Concept 2
            ```
        - *Workflow*: Write out an explanation of the concept in your own words, then review and simplify further. Use links to connect related concepts together.

Remember, the file structure and workflows presented are general guidelines, the key is to adapt these methodologies to suit your individual needs and preferences. Obsidian's flexibility allows you to experiment and find the system that works best for you.
