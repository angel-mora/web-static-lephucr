Make an analysis of my expenses and tell me recurrent ones and what are the most expensive expenses



The file structure is not typical and may contain merged cells or irregular data entries. Iâ€™ll refine the analysis further by identifying and extracting the core columns directly related to date, merchant name, and amount. Let me clean and analyze these elements specifically for recurring and high-cost expenses.

It seems that extracting clean expense data directly from this file may be challenging due to the irregular formatting. If possible, could you reformat the file to focus on essential columns (such as date, merchant, and amount) or provide a CSV file with these elements directly? This would make the analysis process more straightforward and accurate.



Iâ€™ve provided an analysis of your recurring expenses and the most expensive individual transactions. Let me know if youâ€™d like additional details on any specific transaction or merchant patterns!

Tell me how I could start saving money

Here are some strategies based on your spending data that can help you start saving:

1. **Limit High-Cost Purchases**:
   - Some large expenses like shopping at high-end stores (e.g., El Palacio de Hierro) are significant. Consider limiting these purchases or exploring alternatives to luxury brands for essential items.

2. **Reduce Spending on Recurring Expenses**:
   - Identify the top recurring merchants and evaluate if those expenses can be reduced. For instance, if gym memberships, subscriptions, or frequent dining out contribute substantially, look for cost-effective alternatives.

3. **Track and Set a Budget for Discretionary Spending**:
   - Discretionary spending, like dining or non-essential shopping, can quickly add up. Setting a monthly budget for such expenses and sticking to it can provide structure and reduce overspending.

4. **Use Cash-Back or Rewards Programs**:
   - If you use credit cards, take advantage of any cash-back or rewards points programs available for categories you spend on often, such as groceries, dining, or travel.

5. **Limit Impulse Purchases with a Waiting Period**:
   - For any non-essential item, consider implementing a 24-hour (or longer) waiting period before purchasing. This can help you avoid impulsive buys and focus on only buying what truly adds value.

6. **Leverage Budgeting Apps**:
   - Apps like Mint or YNAB (You Need a Budget) can help track your expenses, set savings goals, and provide insights on where you can cut back.

7. **Look for Discounts and Promotions**:
   - For purchases that need to be made, look for deals, coupons, or consider buying items in bulk if it provides savings in the long run.

Starting with even a few of these strategies can help you cut down on spending and build up your savings gradually. Let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown on any specific category or further guidance!

suggest me a discretionary spending considering my expense tendencies. Consider the timestamps of those expenses. Tell me specific things, like spend less in X or Y

Based on your spending patterns, here are tailored suggestions for discretionary spending reductions:

1. **Reduce High-Frequency Dining at Restaurants**:
   - **Dining**: Expenses at places like *Ojo de Agua* and *Entrecot* appear frequently. Consider limiting meals at high-cost eateries, especially if theyâ€™re non-essential, and set a weekly or monthly limit for dining out. You might try meal prepping or finding more affordable, healthy dining options.

2. **Reevaluate High-End Shopping**:
   - **Luxury Shopping**: The repeated high costs at *El Palacio de Hierro* suggest a luxury shopping pattern. These expenses can be significant over time. Evaluate if these purchases are essential or if similar items are available from quality but lower-cost stores, like department sales or outlets.

3. **Limit Recreational Purchases**:
   - **Flowers and Miscellaneous Gifts**: Expenses like *Floreria Danae* could be reevaluated. Try setting a monthly budget for gifts and non-essential purchases to reduce spending while still allowing some room for thoughtful gestures.

4. **Reduce Spending on Recurring Gym and Fitness Costs**:
   - **Gym Memberships and Wellness**: Frequent charges like those at *UFC Gym* indicate regular fitness-related expenses. Consider switching to more affordable gyms, using apps for at-home workouts, or exploring shorter membership commitments if youâ€™re not fully utilizing all facilities and services.

5. **Reevaluate Convenience Store Purchases**:
   - **OXXO and Convenience Stores**: Small, frequent purchases here can add up. Plan grocery shopping at once for essentials to avoid these more expensive on-the-go purchases. It may also help to carry healthy snacks to minimize last-minute convenience store runs.

6. **Consider Alternatives to High-Cost Lodging**:
   - **Travel and Hotel Stays**: If travel is regular, as seen with costs like *Hotel Delta Marriott*, consider alternatives such as loyalty programs, off-peak booking, or cost-sharing on accommodations.

These targeted adjustments could help free up a significant portion of your budget without eliminating the things you enjoy entirely. Let me know if you'd like more specific breakdowns or tips for any particular area!

Based on your expense trends, hereâ€™s a suggested monthly budget:

### Monthly Budget Breakdown

1. **Essentials (Rent, Utilities, Groceries)**:
   - **Rent and Utilities**: 30-35% of income

2. **Dining and Entertainment**:
   - **Dining Out**: Limit high-cost restaurants to a few times per month. Set aside **5-7% of income** for eating out, primarily for special occasions or social gatherings.
   - **Entertainment & Recreation** (e.g., *UFC Gym, Flowers/Gifts*): Consider **5% of income** here. Reduce spending on fitness and wellness by exploring more affordable gym memberships or online workout alternatives.

3. **Clothing and Shopping**:
   - **Luxury Shopping (El Palacio de Hierro)**: Reduce high-end shopping and aim to shop only during sales. Allocate **3-5% of income** for clothing and accessories.
   - **Personal Shopping & Non-Essential Items**: Set a maximum monthly limit of **2-3% of income** for gifts and occasional purchases like flowers.

4. **Travel and Lodging**:
   - **Travel Fund**: For travel and accommodations, consider saving **5% of income** each month, even if not traveling monthly. When you do, using saved funds from multiple months can ease the budget strain.
  
5. **Savings**:
   - **Emergency Fund & Long-Term Savings**: Aim to save **15-20% of income** for emergencies and future goals. If possible, automate this to go directly into savings.
