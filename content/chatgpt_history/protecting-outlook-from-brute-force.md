I am receiving a bunch of failed login attempts to brute force my email account, what can I do? It is Outlook

I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. Here are some steps you can take to protect your Outlook email account from brute force attacks:

1. **Change Your Password**: Even if they haven't gotten in, change your password to something strong. Use a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Make it at least 12 characters long.

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: This adds an additional layer of security. Even if someone knows your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second authentication method (like a code sent to your phone).

3. **Check Account Activity**: Outlook allows you to review recent activity. Look for any suspicious sign-ins or unfamiliar devices.

4. **Be Wary of Phishing Emails**: These can sometimes be the precursor to brute force attempts. Don't click on any suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.

5. **Use a Password Manager**: This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.

6. **Backup Important Emails**: In case of a worst-case scenario, have a backup of your critical emails somewhere safe.

7. **Alert Microsoft**: Report the suspicious activity to Microsoft so they can potentially monitor or take actions on their end.

8. **Check for Malware**: Sometimes, brute force attacks can be coupled with malware to extract saved passwords. Run a reputable antivirus scan on your devices.

9. **Educate Yourself**: Stay updated about common hacking techniques and cybersecurity best practices.

10. **Monitor Other Accounts**: If your email is being targeted, there's a possibility other accounts linked to that email (like banking or social media) could be targeted as well. Consider updating those passwords and enabling 2FA where possible.

Lastly, always be vigilant. If something seems off or suspicious, it's better to take precautionary steps early on.

How can I migrate from one email to a new one?

Migrating from one email account to a new one can be broken down into several steps. Here's a simplified guide:

1. **Set Up the New Email Account**: If you haven't already, sign up with your chosen email service provider.

2. **Forward Incoming Emails**:
   - Go to the settings of your old email account.
   - Look for the "Forwarding" option.
   - Enter the address of your new email account to automatically forward incoming emails. This ensures you don't miss out on any new emails sent to your old address.

3. **Import Old Emails and Contacts**:
   - Many email services, like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo, offer an "Import" feature.
   - This feature allows you to migrate emails, contacts, and sometimes even calendar events from one account to another.
   - Check the settings or help documentation of both your old and new email providers for specific steps.

4. **Notify Important Contacts**: Inform friends, family, and important contacts (like banks, utility services, subscriptions) about your new email address. 

5. **Update Online Accounts**: Go through accounts that are linked to your old email (e.g., social media, online shopping sites) and update them with the new email address.

6. **Organize the New Email Account**: Set up folders, labels, or categories as needed. Set up filters or rules to automatically sort incoming emails if desired.

7. **Export and Backup**: It's a good idea to have a backup of your emails. Use the export feature in your old email to download an archive of all your emails.

8. **Check Your Old Email Periodically**: Even with forwarding in place, it's a good idea to check the old email occasionally for any missed emails or notifications.

9. **Unsubscribe from Unwanted Emails**: As promotional emails come into your new inbox, use this as an opportunity to unsubscribe from ones you no longer find valuable.

10. **Consider an Auto-Responder**: In your old email account, set up an auto-responder that notifies senders of your new email address. Just be cautious, as this could inform potential spammers of your new email.

11. **Secure Both Accounts**: Ensure both your old and new accounts have strong, unique passwords. Also, enable two-factor authentication if available.

12. **Deletion (Optional)**: If you decide to, you can delete your old email account after you're confident all necessary data has been migrated and everyone relevant has been notified. However, many people opt to keep the old account for a while just in case.

Remember, the specific steps can vary depending on the email service providers you're migrating between, so always consult their help documentation or support if you encounter any issues.

How about cellphone?

Migrating data from one cellphone to another can be a bit more involved because of the variety of data types (contacts, apps, photos, messages, etc.) and potential differences in operating systems. Here's a general guide for both Android and iOS:

### Android to Android:

1. **Google Backup**: Ensure that your old Android device is backed up to Google Drive. 
    - Go to "Settings" > "System" > "Backup" and turn on the backup service.
    - This will back up app data, call history, contacts, device settings, and SMS messages.

2. **Start New Device**: Power on your new Android device. During the setup process, you'll be prompted to copy apps and data from your old device.
  
3. **Restore**: Log in with the same Google account you used on your old phone and choose to restore from the backup.

4. **Photos and Videos**: If you use Google Photos, ensure sync is turned on in the app. Once logged in on the new device, your photos and videos will be available.

5. **Other Data**: For other files and data, you might need to use Bluetooth, a direct cable connection, or apps like "Samsung Smart Switch" (for Samsung devices) or "SHAREit".

### iOS to iOS:

1. **iCloud Backup**: On your old iPhone, ensure your data is backed up to iCloud.
    - Go to "Settings" > [Your Name] > "iCloud" > "iCloud Backup" and turn on the backup service.
  
2. **Start New Device**: Turn on your new iPhone. You'll see a "Hello" screen. Follow the onscreen setup steps until you get to the "Apps & Data" screen, then tap "Restore from iCloud Backup".

3. **Sign In**: Sign in with the same Apple ID you used on your old iPhone.

4. **Restore**: Choose a backup from the list. Ensure it's the correct one by checking the date and size.

5. **Photos and Videos**: If you have iCloud Photos turned on, your photos and videos will automatically be available once the restore process finishes and you're connected to Wi-Fi.

### Android to iOS:

1. **Move to iOS App**: During the initial setup of your iPhone, you'll see a "Move Data from Android" option. Use the "Move to iOS" app from the Google Play Store on your Android device to facilitate the transfer.

2. **Contacts, Message History, and More**: The "Move to iOS" app can transfer your contacts, message history, camera photos, videos, web bookmarks, and more.

### iOS to Android:

1. **Contacts**: Sync your iPhone contacts to your Google account or export them and then import to your Android.

2. **Photos and Videos**: You can use the Google Photos app on your iPhone to back up photos and videos and access them on your Android device.

3. **Messages**: There are third-party apps and tools like "iSMS2droid" that can help you transfer your SMS messages.

4. **Other Data**: For other data, consider using apps like "SHAREit" or direct cable transfers if supported by your devices.

Regardless of the method, always double-check to ensure your important data has been transferred successfully to the new device before considering any deletions or resets on the old device.
