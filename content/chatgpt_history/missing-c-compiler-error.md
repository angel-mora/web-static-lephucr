ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

It looks like your Ruby build process is failing due to a missing C compiler. To resolve this issue, you'll need to install a C compiler on your system. Here are steps you can take depending on your operating system:

### For macOS:
1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   This will install the necessary build tools, including `gcc` and other compilers.

2. **Re-run your Ruby installation**:
   Once the command-line tools are installed, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv` or `ruby-build`.

### For Ubuntu (or other Debian-based systems):
1. **Update and install build-essential**:
   Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential
   ```
   This will install `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, and other necessary tools for compiling software.

2. **Re-run your Ruby installation**:
   After the installation is complete, try the `ruby-build` command again.

### For other Linux distributions:
- Look for the package manager and install a package similar to `build-essential` or `gcc`.

After installing the necessary tools, you should be able to proceed with the Ruby build without encountering the missing compiler error. If the problem persists, let me know, and we can troubleshoot further.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

It looks like the build process is failing due to a missing dependency for the `psych` gem, which is the YAML parser used by Ruby. To resolve this issue, you need to install the necessary YAML development libraries on your system. Here's how to do it on Ubuntu:

### Install the required libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev
```

The `libyaml-dev` package contains the headers required to compile the `psych` extension. After installing this package, try reinstalling Ruby:

### Re-run the Ruby installation:
```bash
rbenv install $(cat .ruby-version) --skip-existing
```

This should resolve the issue with the missing YAML headers and allow Ruby to compile successfully. If you encounter further issues, please share the latest log output, and we can troubleshoot more.
