I have a financial question. Is it better to borrow from Deel or from American Express Platinum Card (services, not credit). Remember, Mexico City. Browse the interests or changes for each one of them



To compare borrowing from Deel versus using services from the American Express Platinum Card in Mexico City, here's a general overview based on available information:

1. **Deel**:
   - Deel is primarily a platform for managing global payroll, HR, and compliance, and it offers services to streamline business operations.
   - Borrowing options might be related to salary advances or business-oriented financial services, but it‚Äôs not a traditional lending service like a bank or credit card provider.
   - Interest rates or fees for borrowing via Deel (if available) could be tied to business solutions or salary advances, and would vary based on your contract or business needs, possibly reflecting rates similar to business loans in Mexico (which hover around 11-13%).

2. **American Express Platinum Card**:
   - The Platinum Card is known for its premium benefits, like access to lounges, concierge services, travel credits, and flexible payment plans.
   - Although it doesn‚Äôt offer traditional "borrowing" in the sense of loans, American Express has *Pay Over Time* and *Plan It* options that allow cardholders to split larger purchases into installments with interest, making it similar to borrowing.
   - Interest rates for Pay Over Time in Mexico typically range from 17% to 22%, which is relatively high but comes with significant perks for travelers and business professionals.
   - If you were looking to use *Plan It* for services rather than goods, you‚Äôd have structured, predictable payments with a defined end date but at a higher interest cost.

**Which is better?**
- **Deel** might be better for business-related borrowing, particularly if you're managing payroll or need salary advances with competitive rates.
- **American Express Platinum** offers more perks and benefits but at higher interest rates, making it ideal for lifestyle or travel-related expenses, rather than strict borrowing.

For a specific breakdown, you‚Äôd need to evaluate the rates offered by Deel (if available for borrowing) versus the Pay Over Time rates on your Platinum card and consider what additional benefits you prioritize (such as travel perks or business management).

When comparing borrowing from Deel and using the American Express Platinum Card in Mexico City, here‚Äôs what you should consider:

1. **Deel Advance**:
   - Deel offers a cash advance service, not a loan. There is no interest, but there is a flat fee of 3% on the amount borrowed, with a minimum fee of $10 USD. The first advance under $50 is fee-free.
   - Advances are capped at $10,000 USD and are available to contractors receiving regular payments through Deel.
   - Repayment happens automatically from future payments from clients, and there is no credit check required„Äê18‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê19‚Ä†source„Äë.

2. **American Express Platinum Card**:
   - The Platinum Card offers services like the *Plan It* feature, which allows you to split large purchases into installments. This service has an associated interest rate, typically around 17-22% for deferred payments in Mexico.
   - Although the interest rates are higher than Deel's flat fee, the Platinum Card comes with extensive travel and lifestyle perks, including access to lounges, concierge services, and more„Äê19‚Ä†source„Äë.

**Which is better?**
- **Deel Advance** is preferable if you are looking for a quick advance with a lower cost (the 3% fee) and no need for a credit check, especially if you receive regular client payments.
- **American Express Platinum Card** is more beneficial if you want to leverage the card‚Äôs luxury benefits and are okay with paying higher interest rates for the installment plans.

Your decision would depend on whether you prioritize cost savings (Deel) or additional lifestyle perks (AmEx).

Cost savings. Is there any case where it worths more to use Amex? If so, provide a graph from a function to visualize it. Consider minimum amount to bottow

The graph above compares the total repayment amounts for borrowing $100 from Deel versus the American Express Platinum Card over 12 months:

- **Deel Advance**: The cost is a flat fee of $10, which remains constant regardless of the repayment period.
- **American Express Platinum Card**: The cost increases over time due to the interest rates (17% and 22% annual rates are shown). After 6-7 months, the cost of borrowing from Amex surpasses Deel‚Äôs flat fee.

**Key Insight**: 
- **Deel** is better for short-term borrowing, where the cost remains lower compared to Amex‚Äôs growing interest. 
- **Amex** might be worth considering only if you can repay quickly (within 1-3 months) and if you value the card's perks, such as travel benefits, which might offset the interest costs.

For cost savings alone, Deel is generally the better option unless you can take advantage of Amex benefits that justify the higher borrowing cost.

Credit score for US credit card as a mexican

As a Mexican resident, obtaining a U.S. credit card like the American Express Platinum requires navigating several specific requirements, particularly around your credit score and U.S. residency status. Here's what you need to know:

### 1. **Credit Score Requirements**
   - **U.S. Credit Score**: Most U.S. credit cards, including the American Express Platinum, require a U.S. credit score. A good credit score (typically 700 or above) is often needed for premium cards like Amex Platinum.
   - **No U.S. Credit History**: If you don‚Äôt have a U.S. credit history, this can pose a challenge. Some financial institutions, however, offer credit-building solutions for international applicants.

### 2. **Options for Mexicans with No U.S. Credit Score**
   - **Global Transfer Program (Amex)**: If you have a Mexican American Express card, you might be able to use American Express‚Äôs *Global Transfer* program. This allows you to apply for a U.S. Amex card based on your existing credit relationship with American Express in Mexico. However, approval isn‚Äôt guaranteed, and the U.S. branch will still check your creditworthiness.
   - **International Banks**: Some international banks with a U.S. presence, such as Citibank or HSBC, offer cross-border banking solutions where your Mexican credit history might help you qualify for U.S. products.

### 3. **Secured Credit Cards**
   - **Starting with a Secured Card**: If you're not eligible for a standard U.S. credit card due to the lack of credit history, you can start with a secured credit card. These cards require a cash deposit and help you build U.S. credit. Once you have a sufficient credit score, you can apply for better cards.

### 4. **Requirements for U.S. Credit Cards**:
   - **Social Security Number (SSN) or ITIN**: Most U.S. credit card applications require a Social Security Number (SSN). If you‚Äôre not a U.S. citizen or resident, you can use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), which can be applied for through the IRS.
   - **U.S. Address**: Many issuers will require a U.S. address for the application. If you don‚Äôt have one, you may need to use a forwarding service or a relative's address in the U.S.

In summary, while it‚Äôs possible to get a U.S. credit card as a Mexican citizen, you'll either need to build a U.S. credit history or rely on international banking relationships and programs like American Express‚Äôs *Global Transfer*.

I think there is something like Clerky but to get US Visa for YC entrepreneurs

User is looking for a service similar to Clerky to help YC entrepreneurs obtain a U.S. visa.

Model set context updated.

There isn't a specific service exactly like Clerky for obtaining U.S. visas, but there are options tailored for entrepreneurs, especially those involved with startups like those in Y Combinator. Here are some paths:

1. **E-2 Visa (Treaty Investor Visa)**: This is one of the easier visas for entrepreneurs from countries with a treaty with the U.S. (which includes Mexico). It requires a substantial investment, typically ranging from $100,000 to $300,000, in a U.S. business. This visa can be renewed indefinitely as long as the business remains active. However, it doesn‚Äôt lead directly to a green card„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê35‚Ä†source„Äë.

2. **International Entrepreneur Rule (IER)**: This allows foreign startup founders to stay in the U.S. for up to five years if their startup shows significant growth potential and can create jobs for U.S. workers. It‚Äôs not technically a visa but allows for temporary parole. You must own a significant share of the startup and secure substantial investment„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê34‚Ä†source„Äë.

3. **L-1 Visa**: For those transferring to a U.S. branch of a foreign company. This can be a good option if your business already has an international presence„Äê35‚Ä†source„Äë.

For more details and potential legal assistance, it's beneficial to consult with specialized visa service providers like *Global Citizen Solutions* or *Visa Franchise*, which offer expert help in navigating these entrepreneurial visas„Äê34‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë.
