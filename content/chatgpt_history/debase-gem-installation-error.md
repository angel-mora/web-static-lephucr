This error often occurs because the `debase` gem does not fully support Ruby versions beyond 3.0, especially in systems like Apple Silicon. Here are some steps to resolve it:

1. **Use an Older Ruby Version:** Since `debase` is more compatible with earlier Ruby versions, try switching to Ruby 3.0 or below. You can manage Ruby versions with `rbenv` as follows:

   ```bash
   rbenv install 3.0.0
   rbenv global 3.0.0
   gem install debase -v 0.2.4.1
   ```

2. **Install Debugging Libraries:** Ensure you have the required build dependencies for `debase`, particularly `ruby-dev` or similar packages. Try running:

   ```bash
   brew install openssl readline libyaml
   ```

3. **Use `--with-ruby-include` Option:** If `vm_core.h` or other headers are missing, explicitly provide the path to Ruby headers. For example:

   ```bash
   gem install debase -v 0.2.4.1 -- --with-ruby-include="$(rbenv root)/versions/3.2.2/include/ruby-3.2.2"
   ```

4. **Alternative Debugging Tools:** If `debase` is not mandatory, consider using the `byebug` gem, which is well-supported and often simpler to install on newer Ruby versions.

If these suggestions donâ€™t resolve the issue, let me know so we can look deeper into the specific `mkmf.log` details or other debugging alternatives.

debase dependencies for mac

For installing `debase` on macOS, especially on newer systems like Apple Silicon, here are some dependencies and steps to help ensure a smoother installation:

1. **Update Xcode and Command Line Tools:**
   - Make sure Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools are updated. You can update Command Line Tools by running:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - `debase` might require libraries such as `openssl`, `readline`, and `libyaml`. Use Homebrew to install these:
     ```bash
     brew install openssl readline libyaml
     ```

3. **Set Required Flags for OpenSSL and Readline:**
   - When compiling native extensions, macOS might not automatically find libraries installed with Homebrew. Set the flags so Ruby can locate OpenSSL and Readline:
     ```bash
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"
     ```

4. **Reinstall Ruby with Proper Flags (if necessary):**
   - If the above doesnâ€™t work and `debase` still has issues finding the headers, reinstall Ruby with the correct configuration. Hereâ€™s how with `rbenv`:
     ```bash
     RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl)" rbenv install 3.2.2
     ```

5. **Install `debase` with Custom Include Path:**
   - If `debase` continues to struggle with missing headers like `vm_core.h`, explicitly specify the path to the Ruby headers:
     ```bash
     gem install debase -v 0.2.4.1 -- --with-ruby-include=$(rbenv root)/versions/3.2.2/include/ruby-3.2.2
     ```

6. **Alternative Gems:**
   - If `debase` continues to pose issues, consider using alternatives like `byebug` or `debug` for Ruby debugging, as they may have better compatibility with newer macOS versions.

These steps should help resolve most issues with `debase` dependencies on macOS. If more specific errors persist, please share, and we can address them individually.
