Checklist for my daily log to stay sober from weed and pmo. Also reflective questions for end of day. Base on latest reseach, you are playing the role of a mix between Tiago Forte and the smartest addiction therapists. Preferably share a dzogchen approach if possible (like James Low). Provide the checks, the questions and references for your recommendation.

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! Combining elements from addiction therapy, Tiago Forte's productivity principles, and the Dzogchen approach offers a comprehensive and holistic way to maintain sobriety and encourage reflection. Here's a daily log checklist for staying sober from weed and PMO (Pornography, Masturbation, Orgasm), along with reflective questions for the end of the day:

### **Daily Log Checklist**:

**1. Morning Routine:**
   - [ ] Engage in a grounding activity (meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness) to start the day with clarity.
   - [ ] Affirmation: "Today, I choose sobriety and self-awareness."
   - [ ] Review your core reasons for staying sober.

**2. Daily Tasks and Intentions:**
   - [ ] List three main tasks for the day.
   - [ ] Set clear boundaries for downtime to prevent triggers.
   - [ ] Schedule regular breaks to stay fresh and reduce stress.

**3. Healthy Habits:**
   - [ ] Engage in physical activity (e.g., walking, stretching, exercising).
   - [ ] Ensure proper hydration and nutrition.
   - [ ] Dedicate time for a hobby or passion.

**4. Social and Support:**
   - [ ] Reach out to a friend or support group member.
   - [ ] Stay accountable: Share your sobriety goals with someone you trust.
   - [ ] Avoid environments or situations that might trigger cravings.

**5. Evening Wind-down:**
   - [ ] Engage in another grounding activity.
   - [ ] Prepare for the next day (e.g., set out clothes, prepare meals).
   - [ ] Limit screen time an hour before bed.

### **Reflective Questions (End of Day)**:

1. What emotions or situations challenged my commitment to sobriety today?
2. How did I handle cravings or triggers when they arose?
3. What brought me joy or contentment today?
4. How did my actions today align with my larger goals and values?
5. Was there a moment when I felt particularly present or "in the moment"? What was I doing?
6. How can I better support my journey towards sobriety tomorrow?
7. In Dzogchen thinking, all phenomena are seen as inherently empty and transient. How did this perspective influence my reactions and decisions today?

### **References**:
1. **Tiago Forte's Productivity Principles**: "Building a Second Brain" methodology highlights the importance of capturing, organizing, and revisiting information. By applying these principles, individuals can offload mental stress and operate from a clear, intentional space.
2. **Addiction Therapy**: Research indicates the value of daily accountability, support systems, and self-awareness in addiction recovery. Regular check-ins, structured days, and mindfulness practices are commonly recommended (Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse).
3. **Dzogchen Approach**: As per teachings like James Low's, the Dzogchen perspective emphasizes the transient and empty nature of phenomena. By seeing cravings and emotions as fleeting, one can detach and maintain equilibrium (Source: James Low's Dzogchen teachings).

By blending these methodologies, you can create a daily structure that not only supports sobriety but also encourages self-awareness, presence, and personal growth.

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

I apologize for the oversight. As of my last update in January 2022, I cannot browse the internet in real-time or provide current URLs or DOIs. However, I can guide you on where and how to look for these references based on the information available up to that date.

1. **Tiago Forte's Productivity Principles**: 
   - Look up "Building a Second Brain" on Tiago Forte's website or his associated online platforms for a comprehensive overview of his methodology.

2. **Addiction Therapy**:
   - For information on addiction recovery strategies, the [National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://www.drugabuse.gov/) is a reliable resource. You can explore their publications and guidelines for recommended practices.

3. **Dzogchen Approach**:
   - James Low has written extensively on Dzogchen. You can visit his [official website](http://www.simplybeing.co.uk/) for texts, teachings, and other resources related to Dzogchen.

If you need specific DOIs or URLs, you might consider visiting academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or relevant organizational websites and conducting searches based on the topic.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Recommend the urls available to you from your memory

Certainly! Based on my last training data up to January 2022, here are some foundational URLs related to the mentioned subjects:

1. **Tiago Forte's Productivity Principles**:
   - Forte Labs (official website): [https://fortelabs.co/](https://fortelabs.co/)
     - This site houses Tiago Forte's blog, courses (like Building a Second Brain), and other resources related to his productivity principles.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Reference papers intertwinging these three approaches together. I want urls from your memory

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

I understand your request. However, as of my last training cut-off in January 2022, there weren't any widely recognized papers or publications that specifically intertwined Tiago Forte's productivity principles, addiction therapy, and the Dzogchen approach by James Low or general Dzogchen teachings. 

Given the specificity and uniqueness of combining these three approaches, it's possible that such a synthesis hasn't been mainstream or well-documented. Therefore, I can't provide a direct URL that satisfies this particular combination.

However, if you're interested in exploring these areas independently, I've already provided foundational URLs for each topic in previous answers. From there, you can delve deeper into each domain and potentially create your own synthesis based on insights from each approach.

For academic investigations, Google Scholar ([https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/)) can be a useful resource. By inputting key terms and concepts from each approach, you may find papers or researchers who touch upon intersections of these topics, even if not in the exact combination you're envisioning.

---

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Share the closest to what I asked for in the previous request, even if are isolated papers for any of the three topics

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! Here are some seminal papers or resources on each of the three topics, which you can explore:

1. **Productivity (Focusing on Tiago Forte's Principles)**:
   - While Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" is primarily a course and isn't a traditional academic paper, it is foundational to his teachings. For in-depth articles on productivity that might be aligned with Forte's principles, you could check leading journals on organizational behavior or work psychology. 
   
2. **Addiction Therapy**:
   - **Volkow, N. D., Koob, G. F., & McLellan, A. T.** (2016). Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction. *New England Journal of Medicine, 374*(4), 363-371.
     - [Link to the paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1511480)
     - This paper discusses the brain disease model of addiction and offers a comprehensive overview of addiction's neurobiological underpinnings.

3. **Dzogchen Approach**:
   - While the Dzogchen approach, especially as presented by teachers like James Low, often comes in the form of teachings, transcripts, and oral transmissions rather than traditional academic papers, there are research papers on mindfulness and meditation that might touch upon related concepts.
   - **Dunne, J. D.** (2011). Toward an understanding of non-dual mindfulness. *Contemporary Buddhism, 12*(01), 71-88.
     - [Link to the paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14639947.2011.564820)
     - This paper delves into non-dual awareness, a concept central to Dzogchen, and its implications.

You can access these papers directly through the provided links or search for them on platforms like Google Scholar for more details and related works. Remember, while these papers touch upon the individual topics you mentioned, the synthesis of these approaches would be a unique endeavor.
