The issue here is that `nvm` (Node Version Manager) is not available in the environment where your Rails app is executing. This usually happens because `nvm` is a shell function rather than a system-wide command. When running shell commands via `system`, the Rails process may not load the user's shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) where `nvm` is initialized.

### **Solutions**

#### **1. Use the full path to Node instead of `nvm`**
Since `nvm` is unavailable, you can use the absolute path to Node.js instead:

```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  node_path = `which node`.strip
  npm_path = `which npm`.strip

  system("cd #{local_path} && #{node_path} install && #{npm_path} run build")
end
```

This way, you ensure the system finds the correct Node.js and npm binaries.

---

#### **2. Use `nvm` explicitly in a login shell**
You can force `nvm` to be loaded by using `bash -i` (interactive shell):

```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  system("cd #{local_path} && bash -i -c 'nvm use 20.17.0 && npm install && npm run build'")
end
```

This will load your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` if using zsh), where `nvm` is initialized.

---

#### **3. Source `nvm` manually**
If `bash -i` doesn't work, try manually sourcing `nvm` before using it:

```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  system("cd #{local_path} && source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 20.17.0 && npm install && npm run build")
end
```

Make sure `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` is the correct path to your `nvm` installation.

---

#### **4. Use `nodenv` or a system-wide Node version**
If you have `nodenv` instead of `nvm`, you can use:

```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  system("cd #{local_path} && nodenv local 20.17.0 && npm install && npm run build")
end
```

Alternatively, just ensure you have the correct version of Node installed system-wide and remove the `nvm use 20.17.0` part.

---

### **Check if NVM is Installed Properly**
Run the following in your Rails app environment:

```sh
which nvm
```

If it returns nothing, then `nvm` is not properly loaded in the shell running your Rails processes.

---

### **Recommended Fix**
Try **solution 1 first** (direct `node` path). If that doesnâ€™t work, go for **solution 2** (interactive shell). Let me know how it goes! ðŸš€

=> true
quartz-social-blog(dev)> 

It looks like your Quartz setup script is trying to run `npm install` in the wrong directory or expecting a module that isn't there. Hereâ€™s how to debug and fix it.

---

## **1. Verify that the directory exists and contains the expected files**
Run the following command to check if the directory exists and has a `package.json`:

```sh
ls -lah /Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog/my-blog
```

If this directory does **not** exist, something went wrong with the `git clone` step. If it **does** exist but lacks a `package.json`, the repo may not contain the correct Quartz project files.

---

## **2. Check if Git Clone Worked Properly**
In your `setup_quartz` method, the `git clone` command is supposed to pull the repository. Try running:

```sh
cd /Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog
git status
```

If the folder doesnâ€™t exist or is empty, double-check that `repo_url` is correct.

---

## **3. Fix the `build_quartz_site` Method**
It seems like `npm install` is being run incorrectly. Modify the method to ensure the correct directory is used:

### **Updated Code:**
```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  # Ensure we are in the correct directory
  system("cd #{local_path} && ls -lah && npm install && npm run build")
end
```

### **What This Fix Does:**
- The `ls -lah` command will list the files in the directory so you can check if `package.json` exists before running `npm install`.
- If `npm install` fails because the directory is incorrect, this will give you a clue.

---

## **4. Ensure the Correct Node Version**
The error message shows **Node.js v18.20.4**, but you are trying to use `nvm use 20.17.0`. If your project **requires Node 20**, you need to ensure it's actually available:

Run:
```sh
node -v
```
If it returns `v18.20.4`, you may need to switch to Node 20 manually:
```sh
nvm install 20.17.0
nvm use 20.17.0
```

If `nvm` still isnâ€™t working inside Rails, replace `nvm use` in your script with:
```ruby
system("cd #{local_path} && export PATH=\"$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin:$PATH\" && npm install && npm run build")
```
This ensures Rails uses the correct Node.js version.

---

### **Final Debugging Steps**
1. **Run Quartz manually**  
   Instead of using `setup_quartz`, try running the commands manually in the terminal:
   ```sh
   cd /Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog
   ls -lah  # Check files exist
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   If this works manually but fails in Rails, itâ€™s likely an environment issue.

2. **Check logs for errors**  
   Add `&& echo 'Build successful'` to `system` commands to verify success:
   ```ruby
   system("cd #{local_path} && npm install && npm run build && echo 'Build successful'")
   ```

3. **Ensure repo URL is correct**  
   Manually clone the repo and inspect its contents:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo_url> test_quartz
   ls -lah test_quartz
   ```

Node.js v18.20.4
=> true
quartz-social-blog(dev)> 

Your debugger output shows that `node_path` is set to **Node.js v18.20.4**, but your code explicitly calls for `nvm use 20.17.0`. Since your system is still using Node 18, `npm install` might be failing or installing incompatible dependencies. Let's fix this step by step.

---

## **1. Verify the Correct Path for Node.js**
Before continuing, check if Node 20 is installed:

```sh
nvm install 20.17.0
nvm use 20.17.0
node -v  # Should show v20.17.0
```

If `node -v` still shows **v18.20.4**, your Rails app might not be loading `nvm` properly.

---

## **2. Fix `build_quartz_site` to Use the Correct Node Version**
Instead of relying on `nvm use`, explicitly set the correct Node.js path.

### **Updated Code:**
```ruby
def build_quartz_site
  build_path = File.join(local_path, "public")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)

  node_path = "/Users/spectech/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin/node"
  npm_path = "/Users/spectech/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin/npm"

  system("cd #{local_path} && #{npm_path} install && #{npm_path} run build")
end
```

**Why this works:**  
- It directly uses the Node 20 binary instead of relying on `nvm use`, which isn't recognized inside Rails.

---

## **3. Verify the Correct Directory Structure**
Your error message indicates that `npm install` might be running in the wrong directory:

```
Error: Cannot find module '/Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog/my-blog/install'
```

Check whatâ€™s inside `local_path`:

```sh
ls -lah /Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog/
```

If the directory **does not contain `package.json`**, it means `git clone` might have nested the project incorrectly (e.g., `my-blog/my-blog`). You can fix this by ensuring your `repo_name` is correctly extracted in `setup_quartz`:

### **Fix `setup_quartz`:**
```ruby
def setup_quartz
  repo_name = repo_url.split("/").last.gsub(".git", "").gsub(/@.*$/, "")
  base_path = Rails.root.join("storage", "quartz", repo_name)
  self.local_path = base_path.to_s  # Avoid double nesting

  unless Dir.exist?(local_path)
    system("git clone #{repo_url} #{local_path}")
  end

  build_quartz_site
  update(local_path: local_path)
end
```

---

## **4. Manually Debug the Build Process**
Try running the steps manually:

```sh
cd /Users/spectech/Documents/quartz-social-blog/storage/quartz/my-blog/
ls -lah  # Ensure package.json exists
npm install
npm run build
```

If these commands fail, then:
- **The repo may be incorrect** â†’ Check `repo_url`
- **`package.json` might be missing** â†’ Check `git status`
- **Dependencies might be broken** â†’ Try `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

---

## **Final Steps**
1. Fix `setup_quartz` to prevent double nesting (`my-blog/my-blog` issue).
2. Hardcode the correct `node` and `npm` paths.
3. Manually verify the directory contents and run `npm install`.

How should I render each quarts instance so it gets build and is available through the rails paywall? Am I using the right approach? Can I orchestrate those static site builds from the rails app itself?



Youâ€™re on the right track, but let's refine your approach to ensure that each Quartz instance gets built correctly and is served through your Rails paywall efficiently.  

### **1. The Right Approach: Storing and Serving Quartz Sites**  
Your goal is to:  
- Clone/build the Quartz repo for each user.  
- Store the generated static files.  
- Serve them behind a paywall in your Rails app.  
- Rebuild when changes occur.  

There are **two main approaches** to serving the static sites while keeping them behind a Rails paywall:  

### **Approach 1: Serve Built Files via Rails (`send_file`)**  
- **Pros:** Simple, works with authentication, no need for extra services.  
- **Cons:** Less performant than a dedicated web server (e.g., Nginx).  

#### **Steps**  
1. **Modify `QuartzInstance` to store built sites in `storage/quartz/{repo_name}/public`**
2. **Create a controller to serve static files**  

```ruby
class QuartzSitesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def show
    quartz_instance = current_user.quartz_instances.find(params[:id])
    site_path = File.join(quartz_instance.local_path, "public", params[:path] || "index.html")

    if File.exist?(site_path)
      send_file site_path, type: "text/html", disposition: "inline"
    else
      render plain: "Not Found", status: :not_found
    end
  end
end
```
3. **Modify Routes to Handle Quartz Requests**  
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/quartz/:id/*path", to: "quartz_sites#show", as: :quartz_site
end
```
4. **Access a user's Quartz site**  
   Example: `/quartz/1/index.html`

---

### **Approach 2: Proxy Requests to Nginx (Better for Performance)**
Instead of serving the files via Rails, you can have **Rails authenticate users** and then **proxy requests to an Nginx server** that serves the built Quartz sites.

#### **Steps**
1. **Store sites in `/var/www/quartz_sites/{repo_name}`**  
   Update `QuartzInstance`:
   ```ruby
   def build_quartz_site
     build_path = "/var/www/quartz_sites/#{id}"
     FileUtils.mkdir_p(build_path) unless Dir.exist?(build_path)
     system("cd #{local_path} && npm install && npm run build && mv public #{build_path}")
   end
   ```
2. **Configure Nginx to Serve Built Quartz Sites**  
   Add this to your Nginx config:
   ```
   location /quartz/ {
       internal;
       alias /var/www/quartz_sites/;
   }
   ```
3. **Modify Rails Controller to Authenticate & Proxy**  
```ruby
class QuartzSitesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def show
    quartz_instance = current_user.quartz_instances.find(params[:id])
    if quartz_instance
      redirect_to "/quartz/#{quartz_instance.id}/#{params[:path] || 'index.html'}"
    else
      render plain: "Not Found", status: :not_found
    end
  end
end
```

This way, Rails handles **authentication** but **Nginx serves the files**, making it much more efficient.

---

## **2. Orchestrating Builds from Rails**  
You want Quartz site builds to happen **on-demand** inside Rails. Hereâ€™s how:

### **Trigger Builds in the Background**
Instead of blocking Rails requests while running `git pull && npm run build`, use **ActiveJob** to handle builds asynchronously.

```ruby
class QuartzBuildJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(quartz_instance_id)
    quartz_instance = QuartzInstance.find(quartz_instance_id)
    system("cd #{quartz_instance.local_path} && git pull origin main && npm install && npm run build")
  end
end
```
Then, trigger it whenever necessary:
```ruby
QuartzBuildJob.perform_later(quartz_instance.id)
```

#### **When to Trigger?**
- **On Quartz instance creation** (`after_create :setup_quartz`)
- **When user requests a manual rebuild** (button in UI)
- **On webhook from GitHub when repo changes**  

---

## **3. Handling User Authentication in Builds**  
If each Quartz site should be **user-restricted**, you have two options:

### **Option 1: Require Login for Static Pages**
- Modify Quartz templates to include **Rails authentication checks**.  
- Use **signed URLs** for each page.  

### **Option 2: Store Private Data in Rails**
- Store **metadata (e.g., blog posts, drafts) in Rails**.
- Serve static HTML, but use Rails API calls for **restricted data**.

---

## **Final Recommendation**
If you want simplicity: **Use `send_file` in Rails**.  
If you want high performance: **Use Nginx to serve Quartz sites** and Rails for auth.  
Either way, **use ActiveJob to build Quartz sites asynchronously**.

Would you like help integrating a GitHub webhook to trigger builds automatically? ðŸš€
