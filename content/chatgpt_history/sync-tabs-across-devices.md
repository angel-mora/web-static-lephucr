Syncing tabs and history across devices, including Android and iPhone, involves using a browser that supports cross-platform synchronization. Here are a few options and steps to achieve this:

1. **Google Chrome:**
   - **On Android and iPhone:**
     - Download and install Google Chrome.
     - Sign in with your Google account.
     - Enable sync in Chrome settings to sync tabs, history, bookmarks, and more.
   - **On a computer:**
     - Open Chrome and sign in with the same Google account.
     - Ensure sync is enabled.

2. **Mozilla Firefox:**
   - **On Android and iPhone:**
     - Install Firefox and create a Firefox account.
     - Sign in to your account on the mobile app.
     - Enable sync for tabs and history.
   - **On a computer:**
     - Use Firefox and sign in with your Firefox account.
     - Enable sync settings as needed.

3. **Microsoft Edge:**
   - **On Android and iPhone:**
     - Install Microsoft Edge.
     - Sign in with your Microsoft account.
     - Enable sync in settings.
   - **On a computer:**
     - Open Edge and sign in with the same account.
     - Configure sync settings.

4. **Apple Safari (limited to Apple ecosystem):**
   - **On iPhone:**
     - Sign in to your iCloud account and enable Safari in iCloud settings.
   - **On Mac:**
     - Sign in with the same iCloud account and enable Safari in iCloud settings.
   - Note: Safari does not support cross-platform sync with Android.

5. **Third-Party Apps:**
   - Some third-party apps offer sync features but might require additional setup and aren't as seamless as browser-integrated solutions.

Always ensure you're using the same account across all devices for seamless syncing. Additionally, check the specific sync settings in each browser to customize what data is synchronized.
