I am planning to build a remote knowledge base with obsidian, should it be a NAS or regular server?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Whether to use a NAS or a regular server for your remote knowledge base with Obsidian depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Both options can work well, but they have some differences in terms of functionality, ease of use, and cost.

A NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a specialized device that is designed to store and share files over a network. It provides a centralized location for storing files that can be accessed from multiple devices and users. A NAS can be a good choice for a remote knowledge base with Obsidian if you need to store and share a large number of files and documents. A NAS typically comes with pre-installed software that provides file sharing, backup, and synchronization features, which can be useful for managing your knowledge base.

On the other hand, a regular server gives you more flexibility and control over your system. You can install and configure any software and services that you need, including Obsidian, and customize your server to meet your specific requirements. A regular server can be a good choice if you need more advanced features or want to integrate your knowledge base with other systems or applications.

In terms of cost, a NAS is typically more affordable than a regular server, especially if you choose a low-end model. However, a regular server can provide more value for your money if you need more powerful hardware or advanced features.

In summary, both a NAS and a regular server can be used for a remote knowledge base with Obsidian, depending on your specific needs and preferences. If you need a simple and easy-to-use solution for storing and sharing files, a NAS can be a good choice. If you need more advanced features and customization options, a regular server may be a better fit.

I am planning to build a remote knowledge base with obsidian, should it be a NAS or regular server over raspberry?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Whether to use a Network Attached Storage (NAS) or a regular server over Raspberry Pi for your remote knowledge base with Obsidian depends on your specific needs and requirements.

If you plan to store large amounts of data and want to access it remotely from multiple devices, then a NAS can be a good option. A NAS is a dedicated storage device that provides centralized storage for your data and allows you to access it from multiple devices on the same network. It can also provide additional features like file sharing, backup, and media streaming.

On the other hand, if you plan to run Obsidian as a web application and want more flexibility and control over the server, then a regular server over Raspberry Pi can be a better option. With a regular server, you can install and configure the software and services that you need, and have more control over the server's performance and security.

However, keep in mind that running a server requires more technical knowledge and effort than using a NAS, and you will need to take additional security measures to protect your data and server.

Ultimately, the decision between using a NAS or a regular server over Raspberry Pi for your remote knowledge base with Obsidian depends on your specific needs, skills, and preferences.
