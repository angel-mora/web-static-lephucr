In this markdown, each place holder is a yaml variable that you can replace with your personal data, and it will be rendered as a cover letter.


Now give me a script to transform that to pdf from vscode once I have filled those values.

You can use a Visual Studio Code extension called "Markdown PDF" to convert your markdown file to PDF. 

1. Install the "Markdown PDF" extension in Visual Studio Code by searching for it in the Extensions pane and then click install.

2. Once the extension is installed, open your markdown file that you want to convert to PDF.

3. Click on the "Markdown PDF" button in the bottom right corner of the editor window or use the shortcut `ctrl+shift+p`

4. Select "Export (settings.json)" 

5. On the settings.json file that is opened, add this in the settings:
```
"markdown-pdf.styles": ["styles/custom.css"]
```

6. Replace "styles/custom.css" with the path of your css file if you have any.

7. Save the settings.json file

8. Go back to your markdown file and rerun the export process.

9. The extension will generate a PDF file in the same directory as the markdown file, and it should have the same name as the markdown file but with the .pdf extension.

10. Once you fill all the yaml variables, you can run the script again to generate the final pdf.

Note: The extension uses the markdown-it library to parse the markdown, so it should work with most standard markdown syntax.
