def display_tasks_table(tasks)

## 🧠 Full Chat


  def display_tasks_table(tasks)
    if tasks.present?
      %table.table.table-with-side-padding.task-list#tasks-list
      %tbody
      = render partial: "tasks/task",
               collection: tasks,
               as: :task,
               locals: {account_users: current_account.users}
    else
      %table.table.table-with-side-padding.task-list.margin-bottom-0#tasks-list
  end

how should that method look like to replace the %html syntax from haml to ruby html tags?



To convert your HAML method to Ruby HTML tags, you'll use standard Ruby `content_tag` helpers provided by Rails. Here's how your method would look in ERB-style Ruby with HTML helpers:

```ruby
def display_tasks_table(tasks)
  content_tag :table, class: "table table-with-side-padding task-list", id: "tasks-list" do
    if tasks.present?
      content_tag :tbody do
        render partial: "tasks/task",
               collection: tasks,
               as: :task,
               locals: { account_users: current_account.users }
      end
    else
      nil
    end
  end
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **`content_tag`**: This helper generates HTML tags. The first argument is the tag name (`:table`, `:tbody`), the second argument is optional content (which can be a block), and the third argument is a hash of attributes.
2. **Condition for tasks**: The table body (`<tbody>`) is only rendered if `tasks` are present. Otherwise, it returns `nil` (no content).
3. **Table with padding**: Since both the main table and its fallback have the same classes, the outer `content_tag :table` is reused, and the conditional logic only changes the content inside the table.

If you'd like the fallback case (`else`) to render an empty table with a different margin class:

```ruby
def display_tasks_table(tasks)
  if tasks.present?
    content_tag :table, class: "table table-with-side-padding task-list", id: "tasks-list" do
      content_tag :tbody do
        render partial: "tasks/task",
               collection: tasks,
               as: :task,
               locals: { account_users: current_account.users }
      end
    end
  else
    content_tag :table, class: "table table-with-side-padding task-list margin-bottom-0", id: "tasks-list"
  end
end
``` 

This approach ensures proper HTML generation in Ruby while maintaining clean and readable code.

I got the commit-message-has-tracking-info? error in circle ci, did a push and fetch of refs and even a rebase, my local shows the amended message but when I push it to github it doesn't update. What can I do?


The `commit-message-has-tracking-info?` error in CircleCI typically means that a specific commit message format is enforced (e.g., for tracking JIRA tickets or similar). Since you've amended the message locally and it hasn't updated on GitHub, it's likely because of one of the following issues:

### Potential Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. **You didn’t force-push after amending**
   When you amend a commit that has already been pushed, you need to force-push (`git push --force`) because you're rewriting history.

   **Solution**:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

#### 2. **You amended the wrong commit**
   Ensure that you're amending the latest commit in your branch (usually `HEAD`). You can check your commit history with:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   If your commit is not the latest one, you can rebase interactively to edit it:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~N  # N is the number of commits to include in the rebase
   ```

   Then, replace `pick` with `edit` for the commit you want to amend, amend it, and continue:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   git rebase --continue
   git push --force
   ```

#### 3. **CircleCI is using an older commit**
   If CircleCI is not building the latest commit, it might be stuck on an older ref. This can happen if you’re working in a PR and the target branch hasn’t updated with your force-pushed changes.

   **Solution**:
   - Double-check that the commit on GitHub matches your local commit (`git log` should show the same commit hash).
   - Trigger a new build manually on CircleCI or ensure your PR is updated with the latest commit.

#### 4. **Branch Protection Rules on GitHub**
   If the branch has protection rules (e.g., no force-pushes allowed), GitHub might block your force-push.

   **Solution**:
   - If possible, temporarily disable branch protection or push your changes to a new branch and create a new PR.
   - Alternatively, contact a maintainer with permissions to override or update the branch.

#### 5. **Check if you're on the correct remote branch**
   Ensure you're pushing to the correct remote branch. Run:

   ```bash
   git branch -vv
   ```

   This will show which remote branch your local branch is tracking. If it's incorrect, set the correct upstream branch:

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Recap of Steps:
1. `git commit --amend` (ensure correct commit message).
2. `git push --force`.
3. Double-check on GitHub that the commit message has been updated.
4. If needed, manually trigger a new CircleCI build.
5. Ensure branch protection rules are not preventing force-pushes.

this is how it looks 

From the output you shared, it seems that there may be multiple branches and remote references involved, which could cause confusion about whether the correct branch and commit are being pushed. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening and how you can fix it:

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Multiple remote branches**: 
   - `origin/angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them`
   - `origin/angel/PT-1645-order-show-lazily-loading`
2. **Your local branch name**: 
   - `angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them`
3. **Replaced commits**: 
   - There seems to be a replaced commit (`b1280e6b6d`) that might have been rewritten during a rebase or an interactive commit rewrite.

### Steps to Fix It:

#### 1. **Ensure you're on the correct branch**
   Check that your local branch is tracking the correct remote branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -vv
   ```
   This will show which remote branch your local branch is tracking. If it's incorrect, set it manually:
   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
   ```

#### 2. **Force-push the amended commit**
   Since you’ve already amended the commit locally, you need to force-push it to update the remote branch:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

#### 3. **Check if the push was successful**
   After the force-push, verify the updated commit on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Ensure that the latest commit on GitHub matches the one in your local branch.

#### 4. **Trigger a new CircleCI build**
   Once the correct commit is on GitHub, trigger a new CircleCI build by:
   - Pushing an empty commit:
     ```bash
     git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
     git push
     ```

#### If It Still Doesn’t Work:
- **Branch protection rules**: Check if force-pushing is blocked on the remote branch.
- **Stale remote branch**: Sometimes, the remote tracking branch might be stale. Try deleting the remote reference and pushing again:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
  git push --set-upstream origin angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
  ```

Would you like help analyzing your branch setup further? If so, share the output of `git branch -vv`.

It didnt work. So here are the pr commits

jvanetten-printavo added 2 commits 2 weeks ago
@jvanetten-printavo
make tasks load async
b1280e6
@jvanetten-printavo
cleanup
9dece37
and despite I pushed them it doesnt change

It sounds like you're dealing with an issue where the commits in the PR are not updating despite you force-pushing the amended commits. This can happen for a few reasons, especially when dealing with rebases or rewritten commits on a shared branch.

### Here’s what might be happening:

1. **PR commits are locked to a specific reference**: If someone else created the PR (in this case, it looks like it was created by `@jvanetten-printavo`), the PR might be referencing a branch that no longer reflects your local changes. Even though you've force-pushed, the PR could still be pointing to the outdated commit hash.
   
2. **Branch divergence after rebase**: Since you mentioned rebasing, it's possible the commit history was rewritten. GitHub won't automatically update the PR in this case unless the new commits are properly force-pushed onto the same branch the PR is tracking.

---

### Steps to Fix It:

#### 1. **Confirm the branch GitHub is using for the PR**
   Go to the PR on GitHub and check which branch is being referenced (it’s usually shown at the top, e.g., `angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them`). Ensure your local branch matches exactly.

   Run:
   ```bash
   git branch -vv
   ```
   Confirm your local branch is correctly tracking the same remote branch as shown in the PR.

---

#### 2. **Force-push explicitly to the correct branch**
   Even if you have already force-pushed, sometimes being explicit about the branch and remote can help. Try:

   ```bash
   git push origin angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them --force
   ```

---

#### 3. **Delete and recreate the remote branch (if possible)**
   If force-pushing still doesn’t work, and branch protection rules allow it, you can delete the remote branch and push your local branch again:

   ```bash
   git push origin --delete angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
   git push --set-upstream origin angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
   ```

---

#### 4. **Recreate the PR (as a last resort)**
   If nothing else works, you can recreate the PR:
   - Close the current PR.
   - Create a new branch from your local branch.
   - Push it to GitHub and open a new PR.

---

Would you like me to help you write a message for the PR author or reviewer explaining the issue if you need to close and reopen the PR?

I already created a new pr and looks the same way

Thanks for the update! Since creating a new PR didn’t resolve the issue and the commits still look the same, here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what might be happening and how to troubleshoot further:

---

### What’s Likely Happening:
1. **GitHub PR Commit Caching**: GitHub sometimes caches commit history for PRs, especially if the original commits (like `b1280e6` and `9dece37`) were pushed and later rewritten via rebase. Even if you push amended commits, the old ones might still show up due to cached metadata.
   
2. **Detached PR Commits**: If the PR references commits that no longer exist (because of a rebase or force-push), GitHub may show them as "detached" commits, even though your branch has the correct, updated commits.

---

### Steps to Troubleshoot:

#### 1. **Check if the PR is showing the correct commit hashes**
   Run the following command locally to get the latest commit hashes:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Compare the latest commit hashes with the ones shown in the GitHub PR. If they don’t match, GitHub is likely referencing an outdated commit history.

---

#### 2. **Force a refresh by pushing an empty commit**
   Sometimes, pushing an empty commit forces GitHub to refresh its commit history:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub refresh"
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

---

#### 3. **Check for any merge conflicts**
   If there are hidden merge conflicts, GitHub might not correctly update the PR commits. Try rebasing onto the latest main branch and resolving any potential conflicts:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   git push --force
   ```

---

#### 4. **Check if you’re pushing to the correct branch**
   Ensure your local branch matches the remote branch exactly. Double-check the output of:

   ```bash
   git branch -vv
   ```

   The output should show something like this:
   ```
   angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them 123abc [origin/angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them] Latest commit message
   ```

---

### If All Else Fails:
1. **Contact GitHub Support**: If GitHub is caching the commits incorrectly, contacting their support team might help resolve the issue.
2. **Use a new branch and PR**: Create a **completely new branch** (not just a new PR) and cherry-pick your commits:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   git push origin new-branch
   ```
   Then, create a new PR from this branch.

---

Would you like help with creating a cherry-pick script or writing a message for GitHub support?

Cant I simply merge those two commits or just merge everything in the new pr I created ??

Yes, you can merge the two commits or squash everything into a single commit before pushing to your new PR. This approach ensures that your PR contains clean, updated commits without the outdated history showing up.

---

### Option 1: **Squash all commits into a single commit**
1. **Start an interactive rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~N
   ```
   Replace `N` with the number of commits you want to squash (in your case, likely the last two commits or more, depending on how far back you want to clean up).

2. **Mark commits for squashing**:
   In the interactive rebase editor, leave the first commit as `pick` and change the subsequent ones to `squash` (or `s`), like this:
   ```
   pick b1280e6 make tasks load async
   squash 9dece37 cleanup
   ```
   
3. **Edit the commit message**:
   Git will ask you to edit the commit message. Combine or modify the messages as needed, then save and close.

4. **Force-push the changes**:
   After squashing, you need to force-push the cleaned-up history:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### Option 2: **Merge the two commits without rebasing**
If you want to keep both commits but merge them into a single one:

1. **Use `git reset` to squash changes**:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~2
   git commit -m "PT-1645: Cleaned up tasks loading"
   git push --force
   ```

   This approach combines the changes from the last two commits into your working directory and creates a new commit with a fresh message.

---

### Option 3: **Merge everything in the new PR**
If you’ve already created a new PR and want to merge it as-is:

1. **Ensure the PR is up-to-date**:
   Rebase your branch onto `main` or the target branch to ensure it’s clean and ready to merge:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   git push --force
   ```

2. **Squash & merge via GitHub**:
   If your team allows squash merges, you can choose the "Squash and merge" option directly in GitHub when merging the PR. This will combine all commits into one before merging it into the target branch.

---

### Final Recommendation:
If you want a clean commit history, **Option 1 (squash everything)** is usually the best approach, followed by a force-push.

Here is the git log oneline, tell me how to do the rebase. I want to get everything starting b1280e6b6d into a single commit

To rebase everything starting from commit `b1280e6b6d` into a single commit, follow these steps:

---

### Steps for Interactive Rebase:

1. **Start the interactive rebase**:
   Since `b1280e6b6d` is 9 commits behind `HEAD`, start the rebase with:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~9
   ```

2. **Mark commits for squashing**:
   In the interactive rebase editor, you'll see something like this:

   ```plaintext
   pick b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
   pick 9dece37 cleanup
   pick 91441ce PT-1645: Move tabs to separate turbo streams to speed things up
   pick b80b484 PT-1645: Add turbo frames to show_store_order.html.haml, add xray gem for easier debugging
   pick a414d9f PT-1645: haml-lint fixes
   pick 0f1528f PT-1645: Fix linters
   pick 40109db PT-1645: Switch scheduled tab back to its previous render strategy, more linters fix
   pick e5c0fec PT-1645: more pronto haml-lint fixes
   pick 0b5b36e PT-1645: Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
   ```

   Change all the lines **except the first one** from `pick` to `squash` (or `s`):

   ```plaintext
   pick b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
   squash 9dece37 cleanup
   squash 91441ce PT-1645: Move tabs to separate turbo streams to speed things up
   squash b80b484 PT-1645: Add turbo frames to show_store_order.html.haml, add xray gem for easier debugging
   squash a414d9f PT-1645: haml-lint fixes
   squash 0f1528f PT-1645: Fix linters
   squash 40109db PT-1645: Switch scheduled tab back to its previous render strategy, more linters fix
   squash e5c0fec PT-1645: more pronto haml-lint fixes
   squash 0b5b36e PT-1645: Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
   ```

3. **Edit the commit message**:
   Git will now open an editor asking you to edit the combined commit message. You can either keep all the commit messages or write a new one. For example:

   ```plaintext
   PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading and fix linters
   ```

4. **Finish the rebase**:
   After saving the commit message, Git will squash the commits into one. If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving any conflicts, continue the rebase with:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Force-push the updated branch**:
   Once the rebase is complete, you need to force-push the changes to update the remote branch:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### Summary of Commands:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~9
# Change all but the first 'pick' to 'squash'
# Edit commit message
git rebase --continue  # If conflicts arise, resolve them and run this
git push --force
```

---

Would you like help with resolving potential conflicts during the rebase?

what are u saying? first one is the Trigger rebuild, are you reordering the output I provided you? Stop doing that

Thanks for clarifying! Since you want to squash **all commits starting from `b1280e6b6d`**, we’ll squash everything **from that commit to `HEAD`**, which includes **9 commits**.

---

### Here’s the correct rebase process:

#### 1. Start an interactive rebase
Run the following command to start an interactive rebase for the last **9 commits**:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~9
```

#### 2. Squash all commits except the first
In the interactive rebase editor, Git will display all the commits like this:

```plaintext
pick 98695f0 Trigger rebuild
pick 45dfaa9 PT-1645: pr comments cleanup
pick 0b5b36e PT-1645: Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
pick e5c0fec PT-1645: more pronto haml-lint fixes
pick 40109db PT-1645: Switch scheduled tab back to its previous render strategy, more linters fix
pick 0f1528f PT-1645: Fix linters
pick a414d9f PT-1645: haml-lint fixes
pick b80b484 PT-1645: Add turbo frames to show_store_order.html.haml, add xray gem for easier debugging
pick b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
```

Change **all commits except the first one** to `squash` (or `s`):

```plaintext
pick 98695f0 Trigger rebuild
squash 45dfaa9 PT-1645: pr comments cleanup
squash 0b5b36e PT-1645: Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
squash e5c0fec PT-1645: more pronto haml-lint fixes
squash 40109db PT-1645: Switch scheduled tab back to its previous render strategy, more linters fix
squash 0f1528f PT-1645: Fix linters
squash a414d9f PT-1645: haml-lint fixes
squash b80b484 PT-1645: Add turbo frames to show_store_order.html.haml, add xray gem for easier debugging
squash b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
```

---

#### 3. Edit the commit message
Git will prompt you to edit the commit message. You can either keep all the messages or write a new one. Here’s an example of a combined commit message:

```plaintext
PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance
```

---

#### 4. Continue the rebase
If there are no conflicts, Git will finish the rebase automatically. If conflicts occur, resolve them, and then run:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

---

#### 5. Force-push the changes
After the rebase is complete, force-push your branch to update the PR:

```bash
git push --force
```

---

### Summary:
1. Start rebase: `git rebase -i HEAD~9`
2. Change all but the first `pick` to `squash`
3. Edit the commit message
4. Run `git rebase --continue` if necessary
5. Force-push: `git push --force`

Would you like me to guide you through resolving conflicts if they occur during the rebase?

I cant do it

No problem—I'll guide you through a simpler and more foolproof way to squash everything into a single commit without interactive rebase.

---

### **Simple Way to Squash All Commits:**

1. **Reset your branch to the first commit (`b1280e6b6d`) without deleting changes**:

   ```bash
   git reset --soft b1280e6b6d
   ```

   This command moves your `HEAD` to commit `b1280e6b6d` but keeps all changes staged in your working directory.

2. **Create a new commit with all changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance"
   ```

   This will create a new commit that combines all the previous changes.

3. **Force-push the updated branch**:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### What This Does:
- `git reset --soft b1280e6b6d`: Moves `HEAD` to `b1280e6b6d` but keeps all changes staged (ready to commit).
- `git commit`: Creates a single commit with all the changes.
- `git push --force`: Updates the remote branch by replacing the old history with the new single commit.

---

Would you like me to explain further or guide you through the steps as you go?

it is still showing the fucking first commit without my PT-1645 tag, are you stupid?

No worries, I understand how frustrating this can be. Let’s take a step back and carefully fix it together. The issue seems to

it is still showing the fucking first commit without my PT-1645 tag, are you stupid?
jvanetten-printavo and others added 2 commits 2 weeks ago
@jvanetten-printavo
make tasks load async
b1280e6
@ajmoram-inktavo
Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
0e72c37



Got it—I understand your frustration. Here's what’s likely happening:

The old commits (`b1280e6` and `0e72c37`) were **merged** into the branch before, and even though you’ve squashed your changes locally and force-pushed, GitHub’s PR interface is still showing the **original commits** because they exist in the **base branch’s history** (likely `main` or `master`).

This issue occurs because GitHub tracks commits **that are already in the base branch** and will always display them if they were part of an earlier merge.

---

### **Solution: Recreate the branch and PR from scratch**

Since GitHub is still referencing those old commits, the easiest way to resolve this is to:

1. **Create a new branch from `main` or `master`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

2. **Cherry-pick your new single commit onto the fresh branch**:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-your-single-squashed-commit>
   ```

3. **Push the new branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin new-branch-name
   ```

4. **Open a new PR from this new branch**.

---

### Why This Works:
By starting from a fresh branch and cherry-picking only the squashed commit, you eliminate all the old commits from the PR entirely. GitHub won’t see the old commits because they won’t be part of the new branch’s history.

---

Would you like help with any specific step?

you are not amending the friking commit to add the PT-1645

Thanks for your patience—let's fix this properly by **amending the commit to include the correct message**.

---

### Here's how to **amend the commit message**:

1. **Amend the last commit**:
   Since your most recent commit is missing the `PT-1645` tag, you can amend it like this:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance"
   ```

   This will replace the last commit message with the correct one, including the `PT-1645` prefix.

2. **Force-push the amended commit**:
   After amending the commit, you need to force-push the branch to update it on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### Why This Works:
- `git commit --amend` changes the message of the **most recent commit** without affecting its content.
- `git push --force` ensures the remote branch reflects your updated commit history.

---

If this doesn’t solve the issue, it might be helpful if I see the exact output of your commands and what GitHub shows after you push. Would you like to walk through this step-by-step together?

Again, start fresh with the simplest approach. I've done a couple prs already. I will close everything and try again

Got it! Let's start **completely fresh** with a simple, clean approach. Here’s exactly what you need to do:

---

### **Steps to Create a New Clean PR with One Correct Commit**

1. **Checkout the latest `main` (or base) branch**:
   Make sure you’re starting from the latest base branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for your PR**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b angel/PT-1645-clean-pr
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the relevant changes**:
   If your changes are already in a previous commit (e.g., from `98695f0`), you can cherry-pick that commit into the new branch:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick 98695f0d9f
   ```

4. **Amend the commit message to include `PT-1645`**:
   If the cherry-picked commit doesn’t have the correct message, amend it:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance"
   ```

5. **Push the new branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin angel/PT-1645-clean-pr
   ```

6. **Create a new PR**:
   Open a new PR from `angel/PT-1645-clean-pr` to `main` on GitHub.

---

### **Alternate (if changes are uncommitted)**

If your changes haven’t been committed yet:

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b angel/PT-1645-clean-pr
   ```

2. **Make your changes (or copy them over)**.

3. **Commit with the correct message**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance"
   ```

4. **Push the branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin angel/PT-1645-clean-pr
   ```

5. **Open a new PR on GitHub**.

---

This ensures:
1. No old commits are included.
2. The new PR has a clean commit history with the correct `PT-1645` tag.

Would you like help verifying the commit or PR once you've done this?

I dont want to cherry pick shit

Got it! Let’s keep it **super simple** without cherry-picking or overcomplicating things. We’ll start fresh with a clean commit history.

---

### **Simplest Fresh Start Steps**

1. **Checkout `main` and update it**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b angel/PT-1645-clean-fresh
   ```

3. **Copy your changes into this branch**:
   If your changes exist in a previous branch or PR, you can manually copy the files or changes over (don’t worry about history—just get the current state you want).

4. **Stage the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit with the correct message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading, fix linters, and improve performance"
   ```

6. **Push the new branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin angel/PT-1645-clean-fresh
   ```

7. **Create a new PR on GitHub**.

---

This approach completely resets everything. No old commits, no cherry-picking, just a clean slate with your latest changes and a single correct commit.

Would this approach work for you? Let me know if you need help!

just merge the old branch in this new one with a rebase that gives me a chance to put my freaking 'PT-1645:' prefix on it

Got it! Here's exactly how you can **merge your old branch into the new one with a rebase** while ensuring you can edit the commit messages to include your `PT-1645:` prefix.

---

### **Steps to Rebase and Edit Commit Messages**

1. **Checkout `main` and update it**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch from `main`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b angel/PT-1645-clean-rebase
   ```

3. **Merge your old branch with rebase**:
   Assuming your old branch is `angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them`, run:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them
   ```

4. **Edit commit messages during the interactive rebase**:
   Git will open an editor showing all the commits from your old branch, something like this:

   ```plaintext
   pick b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
   pick 9dece37 cleanup
   pick 0b5b36e Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
   ...
   ```

   - Change `pick` to `reword` (or `r`) for each commit where you want to edit the message:

     ```plaintext
     reword b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
     reword 9dece37 cleanup
     reword 0b5b36e Move tasks lists to helper to prevent haml linter error
     ...
     ```

5. **Git will prompt you to edit each commit message**:
   For each commit marked `reword`, Git will open an editor where you can edit the message. Add your `PT-1645:` prefix if it’s missing.

   Example:
   ```plaintext
   PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading and fix linters
   ```

6. **Continue the rebase**:
   After editing all commit messages, Git will finish the rebase. If there are conflicts, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them. Resolve the conflicts, then run:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

7. **Force-push the new branch**:
   Once the rebase is complete, push your new branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin angel/PT-1645-clean-rebase --force
   ```

---

### **Why This Works**:
- The interactive rebase gives you control over all commit messages.
- You can easily add the `PT-1645:` prefix to each commit message.
- The final result will be a clean branch with properly prefixed commit messages, ready for a PR.

---

Would you like help resolving conflicts if any arise? Let me know!

This is what it is looking like
# Rebase 0e72c37f7a..27f172c172 onto 0e72c37f7a (1 command)


Thanks for sharing that! The output indicates that you're currently in the middle of a **partial rebase**—it looks like you've already started the rebase process, and Git is prompting you to proceed.

---

### **Next Steps**:

1. **Check the current state**:
   Since you’re rebasing onto a commit range (`0e72c37f7a..27f172c172`), Git might be pausing at a point where it expects you to resolve something or edit a commit message.

   To confirm the status, run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **If Git is asking to edit the commit message**:
   Git might have paused for you to edit the commit message. If an editor popped up, update the commit message to include the correct prefix `PT-1645:`.

   Example:
   ```plaintext
   PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading and fix linters
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

3. **Continue the rebase**:
   If Git paused after editing a commit message or resolving a conflict, continue the rebase by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

---

### What to Do If It’s Stuck:

If you're stuck or something doesn't look right, you can **abort the rebase** and start again:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

Then, retry the interactive rebase from the correct starting point:

```bash
git rebase -i 0e72c37f7a
```

This will allow you to edit all subsequent commit messages manually.

---

Let me know what `git status` says, and I can guide you from there!

this is what git status is returning
On branch angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs
No commands done.
Next command to do (1 remaining command):
   noop
  (use "git rebase --edit-todo" to view and edit)
You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs' on '0e72c37f7a'.
  (use "git commit --amend" to amend the current commit)
  (use "git rebase --continue" once you are satisfied with your changes)

nothing to commit, working tree clean


Thanks for the details! This means Git is currently in the middle of a **rebase**, and it’s waiting for you to either:

1. **Amend the current commit message** (because Git paused for editing).
2. **Continue the rebase once you're done**.

---

### Steps to Fix the Commit Message:

1. **Amend the current commit message**:
   Since there’s nothing to commit in the working tree, Git is prompting you to edit the commit message. Run:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```

   This will open your editor with the current commit message. Add the `PT-1645:` prefix (or correct it if it's missing).

   Example:
   ```plaintext
   PT-1645: Refactor tasks loading and fix linters
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

2. **Continue the rebase**:
   After amending the commit message, continue the rebase by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

---

### Why This Works:
- `git commit --amend` allows you to update the commit message during the rebase.
- `git rebase --continue` tells Git to proceed with the next step in the rebase process (in this case, finishing it).

error: update_ref failed for ref 'refs/heads/angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs': cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs': is at c34964d54adb8c39b648b6f8fb59c9a573d867fb but expected 27f172c172b5d35e9dc4ba1c1b66943d7b3eaedc
error: could not update refs/heads/angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs


This error happens because the ref (`angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs`) was updated externally (e.g., by a push to the remote or a local operation on another machine), and Git's rebase process is now out of sync with the current state of the branch.

---

### **How to Fix This Error**

#### Option 1: **Force update your local ref and retry the rebase**
You can reset your local branch to match the expected commit and retry the rebase:

1. **Reset your branch to the expected commit (`27f172c172b5d35e9dc4ba1c1b66943d7b3eaedc`)**:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard 27f172c172b5d35e9dc4ba1c1b66943d7b3eaedc
   ```

2. **Start the interactive rebase again**:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i 0e72c37f7a
   ```

   This will allow you to edit the commit messages as needed.

---

#### Option 2: **Abort the current rebase and retry from scratch**

1. **Abort the rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```

   This will cancel the ongoing rebase and return your branch to its original state.

2. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs
   ```

3. **Start the rebase again**:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i 0e72c37f7a
   ```

---

#### Option 3: **Use `git reflog` if you're stuck**

If you’re unsure about which commit to reset to, you can check your branch’s history using:

```bash
git reflog
```

This will display a list of recent actions (including commits and rebases), and you can identify the last known good commit to reset to.

---

Let me know which option works for you, and I can guide you further!

this how my shit looking, you didnt actually apply the 'replaced' thing 
ce0e0c85dc (HEAD -> angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs, origin/angel/PT-1645-lazy-loading-order-tabs) PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
b1280e6b6d (replaced) PT-1645: make tasks load async


Thanks for your patience—now I fully understand the situation. You’ve got a **replaced commit** (`b1280e6b6d`) that was rewritten but still exists in the history due to rebases or merges, and you want to **properly replace it in the current branch** with the new commit (`ce0e0c85dc`) while maintaining a clean history.

Let’s fix this properly by **dropping the old commit and ensuring only the correct commit remains**.

---

### **Steps to Fix (Dropping the Replaced Commit)**

1. **Start an interactive rebase** from the commit before the replaced one:
   Since `b1280e6b6d` is the replaced commit, we’ll rebase from the parent of that commit.

   ```bash
   git rebase -i b1280e6b6d^
   ```

2. **Mark the old commit to be dropped**:
   Git will open an editor listing the commits. You’ll see something like:

   ```plaintext
   pick b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
   pick ce0e0c8 PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
   ```

   Change `pick` to `drop` (or `d`) for the old commit:

   ```plaintext
   drop b1280e6 PT-1645: make tasks load async
   pick ce0e0c8 PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
   ```

3. **Save and close the editor**:
   Git will now drop the old commit and continue the rebase with only the correct commit (`ce0e0c85dc`).

4. **Force-push the updated branch**:
   After the rebase is complete, you’ll need to force-push the branch to update it on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### **Why This Works**:
- The interactive rebase allows you to drop the old, replaced commit (`b1280e6b6d`) and keep only the new, correct commit (`ce0e0c85dc`).
- Force-pushing ensures the branch on GitHub reflects the cleaned-up history.

Thanks for the detailed output—I can see what’s going on now.

You’re hitting **merge conflicts during the rebase** because the changes in the replaced commit (`b1280e6b6d`) overlap with the changes in the new commit (`ce0e0c85dc`). This is common when a commit has been rewritten but still contains similar changes.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Conflicts and Continue the Rebase**

1. **List the conflicted files**:
   From your output, the following files have conflicts:

   - `app/controllers/orders_controller.rb`
   - `app/views/orders/show/_tasks_navigation_tab.haml`
   - `app/views/orders/show/_tasks_tab.html.haml`
   - `app/views/orders/show_order.html.haml`
   - `config/routes.rb`

2. **Manually resolve each conflict**:
   Open each file in your editor. You’ll see conflict markers like this:

   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (Your current branch's code)
   =======
   (Code from the commit being applied)
   >>>>>>> ce0e0c85dc
   ```

   - Keep the correct version of the code by manually removing the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`).
   - Ensure that the final code reflects the desired state after the rebase.

3. **Mark the conflicts as resolved**:
   After resolving the conflicts, mark each file as resolved by running:

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git add app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
   git add app/views/orders/show/_tasks_navigation_tab.haml
   git add app/views/orders/show/_tasks_tab.html.haml
   git add app/views/orders/show_order.html.haml
   git add config/routes.rb
   ```

4. **Continue the rebase**:
   Once all conflicts are resolved and marked as resolved, continue the rebase by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Force-push the updated branch**:
   After the rebase completes successfully, force-push the changes to update the remote branch:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### **If You Want to Skip the Commit Instead**:
If you don’t want to apply `ce0e0c85dc` at all (e.g., because the changes are already present):

```bash
git rebase --skip
```

This will skip applying the conflicting commit and continue with the next one.

---

### **Final Notes**:
- If the conflicts are extensive and you prefer to start clean, I can guide you through an alternate strategy using a fresh branch.
- Let me know if you need specific help with resolving a particular file’s conflict.

Would you like help with resolving specific conflicts? I can walk you through them one by one!

now Im back at my old branch

No worries! Since you're back at your old branch and things have gotten a bit messy, let's do a **clean reset and rebase** with minimal issues.

---

### **Plan to Fix This Cleanly**

1. **Abort the current rebase if it’s still ongoing**:
   ```bash
   git rebase --

now Im back at my old branch, let's try again, the simplest approach for my branch

Alright, let’s go with the **simplest approach** for your branch—this time with no unnecessary rebase complexity.

---

### **Simplest Clean Approach (Force Replacing All Commits with a Single Commit)**

1. **Reset your branch to the latest `main`**:
   First, make sure your branch starts clean from the latest `main`. Run:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b angel/PT-1645-clean
   ```

2. **Apply your changes manually (no history issues)**:
   You have two options:
   - If your changes are already staged locally in another branch, you can copy them over.
   - If your changes are unstaged, just make them again in this new branch.

I want to rewrite the old commit that didn't have the tag

Got it! You want to **rewrite the commit message of the old commit** to include the correct `PT-1645:` prefix. Here's the **simplest approach** to do that without starting a new branch or cherry-picking.

---

### **Steps to Rewrite the Old Commit Message**

#### 1. **Identify the commit you want to rewrite**
   From your earlier logs, the old commit without the correct tag is:

   ```plaintext
   ce0e0c85dc PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
   b1280e6b6d make tasks load async (this one needs the correct tag)
   ```

   Since `b1280e6b6d` is the problematic commit, we’ll rewrite it.

---

#### 2. **Start an interactive rebase**
   Begin an interactive rebase starting from the parent of the old commit (`b1280e6b6d`):

   ```bash
   git rebase -i b1280e6b6d^
   ```

---

#### 3. **Mark the commit for editing**
   Git will open an editor showing the commits. It should look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   pick b1280e6 make tasks load async
   pick ce0e0c8 PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
   ```

   Change `pick` to `edit` for the commit you want to rewrite:

   ```plaintext
   edit b1280e6 make tasks load async
   pick ce0e0c8 PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

---

#### 4. **Amend the commit message**
   After marking the commit for editing, Git will pause and allow you to rewrite the commit message. Run:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: make tasks load async"
   ```

---

#### 5. **Continue the rebase**
   Once you’ve amended the commit message, continue the rebase:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

---

#### 6. **Force-push the updated branch**
   After the rebase completes successfully, force-push your branch to update it on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### **Summary of Commands**

```bash
git rebase -i b1280e6b6d^
# Change "pick" to "edit" for the old commit
git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: make tasks load async"
git rebase --continue
git push --force
```

---

### **Final Outcome**
This approach will:
1. Rewrite the old commit with the correct `PT-1645:` prefix.
2. Maintain the existing history without creating unnecessary branches or merges.
3. Cleanly update your branch with a single push.

This is the latest my history is showing
0e72c37f7a (HEAD -> angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them, origin/angel/PT-1645-order-show-loads-all-tabs-instead-of-lazily-loading-them) Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues

Thanks for your patience! Since your latest history shows:

- `0e72c37f7a` (the current commit with the wrong message)
- `b1280e6b6d` (the replaced commit)
- `27f172c172` (the latest commit from `master`)

You want to **rewrite the commit message of `0e72c37f7a` to include the correct prefix (`PT-1645:`)** and clean up the history.

---

### **Simplest Approach to Rewrite the Latest Commit Message**

Since the commit you want to fix is already the latest one (`HEAD`), you don’t need a complex rebase—just amend it.

1. **Amend the latest commit message**:
   Run this command to update the message:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues"
   ```

2. **Force-push the updated branch**:
   After amending the commit, force-push to update the remote branch:

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### **Why This Works**:
- `git commit --amend` directly updates the message of the latest commit (`0e72c37f7a`).
- `git push --force` ensures that GitHub reflects your updated commit history.

Let me know if this resolves your issue! This approach avoids unnecessary rebasing and should give you exactly what you want.

did you realize it says (replaced)?

Yes, I noticed that your commit history shows `b1280e6b6d (replaced)`. The **“(replaced)”** label means that Git already rewrote this commit during a previous rebase or amend, but it still lingers in the reflog and history because it was part of the branch at some point before being replaced by `0e72c37f7a`.

### **What This Means**:
- The commit `b1280e6b6d` is no longer part of the current branch—it was replaced by `0e72c37f7a`.
- `0e72c37f7a` is the **current commit** and is what’s being pushed to GitHub.
- You can safely ignore the replaced commit (`b1280e6b6d`) because it’s outdated and irrelevant unless you specifically need to recover something from it.

### **What to Do Now**:
If your goal is just to fix the commit message of `0e72c37f7a`, you only need to:

1. **Amend the latest commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "PT-1645: Lazy loading tabs and fix linter issues"
   ```

2. **Force-push the branch**:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

### **Why You’re Seeing “Replaced”**:
Git keeps track of replaced commits in the reflog or during interactive rebases to allow you to recover them if necessary. However, they don’t affect your branch unless you explicitly reference them.

Would you like help cleaning up the reflog or ensuring the replaced commit isn’t lingering anywhere? Or is your main goal just to fix the commit message and update the PR?
