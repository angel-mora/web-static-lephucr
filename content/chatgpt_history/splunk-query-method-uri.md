# Splunk Query: Method & URI

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I want to make a splunk query to see method and uri_path in a timechart span=1h that shows me the method and the route

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To create a Splunk query that shows the method and uri_path in a timechart with 1-hour spans, you first need to know the names of the fields in your Splunk data that hold the HTTP method and URI path information.

Assuming the field names are `method` and `uri_path`, a simple query to achieve this might look like this:

```spl
index="your_index" sourcetype="your_sourcetype"
| timechart span=1h count by method, uri_path
```

This will give you a count of events per hour for each combination of `method` and `uri_path`. Please replace `"your_index"` and `"your_sourcetype"` with the actual index and sourcetype you are using.

However, this will result in a multivalued timechart, which might not be the most readable. If you want to represent the data differently, for instance, by concatenating the `method` and `uri_path` fields, you can use the `eval` command:

```spl
index="your_index" sourcetype="your_sourcetype"
| eval method_uri=method." ".uri_path
| timechart span=1h count by method_uri
```

This will create a new field `method_uri` combining the method and uri_path, and then build a timechart with 1-hour spans counting the occurrences of each `method_uri` combination.

2. **Security Analysis**:
   - Security teams can leverage geolocation information to detect suspicious activities, such as login attempts from unexpected locations.
   - It helps in identifying patterns and trends in malicious activities based on geographical locations.

3. **Incident Investigation**:
   - Geolocation data can be critical during incident investigations, as it can help trace the origin of malicious traffic.
   - Analysts can correlate geolocation information with other security events to identify and track threat actors.

4. **Compliance & Regulation**:
   - Organizations operating under regional compliance constraints can use geolocation data to ensure adherence to data residency and processing regulations.
   - It helps in auditing and reporting for compliance purposes.

5. **Network Performance Monitoring**:
   - Understanding the geographical distribution of users can help in network performance optimization.
   - Organizations can use geolocation data to identify network latency issues or optimize content delivery based on user location.

6. **User Experience & Marketing Analysis**:
   - Businesses can analyze user behavior and engagement based on geographical locations.
   - Geolocation data can be used for targeted marketing, personalized content delivery, and regional trend analysis.

7. **Easy Integration**:
   - The add-on is designed for easy integration with Splunk, allowing users to seamlessly incorporate geolocation data into their existing dashboards and reports.

8. **Data Enrichment**:
   - By associating IP addresses with geographical locations, organizations can enrich their logs and events with additional contextual information.

Remember to review the documentation and pricing details of the Whois XML IP Geolocation API, as there may be costs associated with API usage, depending on the volume of queries and level of detail required. Additionally, while this add-on can provide valuable insights, itâ€™s important to use geolocation data responsibly and in accordance with privacy laws and regulations.
