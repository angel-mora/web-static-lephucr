An error occurred while installing rbtree (0.4.6), and Bundler cannot
continue.

In Gemfile:
  sorted_set was resolved to 1.0.3, which depends on
    rbtree




The error you're seeing indicates that `rbtree` (a Ruby gem) failed to install, which is causing Bundler to fail as it's a dependency for `sorted_set`.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Ruby Version Compatibility**: The `rbtree` gem may not be compatible with the version of Ruby you are using. Ensure you're using a version of Ruby that is compatible with `rbtree`. If you're using Ruby 3.x, try switching to Ruby 2.7.x, as many older gems are incompatible with Ruby 3.x.

   You can switch Ruby versions using a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`:

   ```bash
   rbenv install 2.7.6
   rbenv global 2.7.6
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: `rbtree` may require some system libraries or build tools to install properly. On macOS, for instance, you can try installing build tools using:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

3. **Use an Alternative Gem**: If `rbtree` is obsolete or problematic to install, you could consider using a more modern alternative. `sorted_set` depends on `rbtree`, but depending on your use case, you may be able to use `rbtree_hash` or replace the `sorted_set` gem with something else (for example, the `containers` gem offers similar functionality).

4. **Update Gemfile**: If you're not specifically relying on `sorted_set`, try removing or replacing it in your `Gemfile`. If it's a transitive dependency, updating other gems may help resolve the issue.

5. **Manual Installation of `rbtree`**: You can try manually installing `rbtree` by cloning it and then installing it locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seattlerb/rbtree.git
   cd rbtree
   rake install
   ```

6. **Gem Binary Extensions**: Since `rbtree` includes C extensions, ensure you have the right tools to compile it. Make sure you have `gcc` or `clang` installed.

If the issue persists after trying these steps, feel free to share any additional error logs, and I can help further debug.

An error occurred while installing mysql2 (0.5.6), and Bundler cannot
continue.

In Gemfile:
  mysql2

The error you're encountering while trying to install the `mysql2` gem typically happens when your system is missing the necessary libraries to build the native extensions that `mysql2` depends on. Here are steps to resolve this issue based on your operating system:

### 1. **macOS:**

If you're on macOS, you'll need to ensure that MySQL and the required headers are installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**: If MySQL is not installed, you can install it via Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install mysql
   ```

2. **Install `mysql2` gem with proper flags**: Since the gem may not automatically detect the MySQL client library paths, you'll want to specify them manually during installation:

   ```bash
   gem install mysql2 -v '0.5.6' -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin/mysql_config
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add the path to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Reinstall the `mysql2` gem**:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

### 2. **Ubuntu/Debian:**

If you're using an Ubuntu or Debian-based system, you need to install MySQL client libraries and development headers:

1. **Install MySQL development packages**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev
   ```

   If you're using an older version of Ubuntu/Debian, use this instead:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
   ```

2. **Reinstall the `mysql2` gem**:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

### 3. **Windows:**

If you're on Windows, you may need to:

1. **Install MySQL**: Download and install MySQL from the official website: [MySQL Installer for Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

2. **Install the `mysql2` gem** using the `--with-mysql-dir` option. You will need to specify the path to the MySQL installation:

   ```bash
   gem install mysql2 -v '0.5.6' -- --with-mysql-dir="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"
   ```

### 4. **General Tip for All Platforms:**

If you want to avoid the hassle of native compilation, you can specify a precompiled version of the `mysql2` gem (if available) or use a version that's known to work with your system. Additionally, ensure that you have the latest `bundler` version:

```bash
gem install bundler
```
