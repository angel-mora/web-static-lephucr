In Gmail, you can use **filters** and **labels** combined with **notifications** to replicate the functionality of Outlook rules. Here's how you can set it up:

---

### **Step 1: Create a Filter for Work Emails**
1. **Go to Gmail**:
   - Open Gmail in your browser.
2. **Access Filters**:
   - Click on the gear icon (**Settings**) in the top-right corner.
   - Select **See all settings**.
   - Go to the **Filters and Blocked Addresses** tab.
3. **Create a New Filter**:
   - Click **Create a new filter**.
   - Define the criteria for your work emails:
     - From a specific email domain (e.g., *@yourcompany.com*).
     - Specific keywords (e.g., "project", "deadline").
     - Sent to a specific email address (if you have multiple accounts linked).
4. **Set Filter Actions**:
   - After defining the criteria, click **Create filter**.
   - Choose actions such as:
     - Apply a label (e.g., "Work").
     - Mark as important.
     - Never send to Spam.

### **Step 2: Set Up Gmail Notifications**
1. **Enable Desktop Notifications**:
   - In **Settings**, go to the **General** tab.
   - Scroll to **Desktop notifications**.
   - Choose **New mail notifications on** or **Important mail notifications on**.
2. **Enable Notifications for the Label**:
   - In the left sidebar, hover over the work label you created.
   - Click the three dots (**More** menu).
   - Select **Label notifications**.
   - Enable **Notify me for every message**.

### **Step 3: Fine-Tune Notifications on Mobile (Optional)**
1. **Open Gmail App**:
   - Go to the Gmail app on your phone.
2. **Configure Notifications**:
   - Go to **Settings** in the app.
   - Select the account you use for work.
   - Under **Notifications**, select **High priority only** or **All new emails**, depending on preference.
   - In **Manage labels**, ensure notifications are enabled for the work label.

### **Step 4: Optional Add-Ons**
For more advanced filtering and automation:
- Use **Google Workspace** or **Gmail Add-ons** for professional tools like **AutoResponder** or **Zapier** to create complex workflows.

With these steps, you'll have a robust system ensuring you never miss work-related emails.
