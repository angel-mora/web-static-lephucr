How can I make a social network within Obsidian?
Make explicit all the facts that I shoud recall as a rails developer (also some js knowledge). Like, Obsidian is a Chromium browser so these X, Y and Z are the things we can do with it. These sort of facts that can make my life simpler. Like, Obsidian could provide SSR and send HTML directly to a web rails application if the could communicate over an Obsidian plugin or something.
Also, provide all the Obsidian plugins I should be aware about and could use as inspiration (or integration). The point of it would be you open the tab of the Social Network as an Obsidian plugin and you have the ability to send over comments/writings from your knowledge base to the web app but still read it over your local obsidian. It then, would also be able to instruct your local Obsidian app to create all calendars and kanban (only frontmatter + obsidian) in your local computer so you don't have to configure anything

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and personal knowledge management application. While it's not inherently a platform for developing social networks, you can creatively leverage its features, plugins, and API to integrate with web applications, including those built with Rails.

### Basic Facts
- **Chromium Based**: Obsidian is Electron-based, which means it runs on a Chromium browser. This allows for the use of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in developing plugins and themes.
- **API and Plugins**: Obsidian offers an API that allows developers to create custom plugins to extend its functionality.
- **Markdown-Based**: Obsidian stores notes in Markdown, making it easy to handle text-based content.

### Building Blocks for a Social Network in Obsidian:

1. **Obsidian Sync Plugin**: This plugin allows you to sync your vault across multiple devices. It could serve as the base for any real-time or syncing functionality.
  
2. **Calendar and Kanban Plugins**: There are plugins available like "calendar" and "kanban" that can manage schedules and tasks. These can be used to create calendars and kanbans on the local machine.

3. **Embedded Web View**: You can embed a web view within Obsidian to interact with your Rails application. This can be a simplified version of your social network.

4. **Custom Plugin Development**: Develop a custom plugin using Obsidian's API. This plugin can interact with your Rails applicationâ€™s API to send/receive data, thus allowing for interaction between your local Obsidian vault and the social network.

5. **Websockets**: You can establish a websocket connection from your custom Obsidian plugin to your Rails server to facilitate real-time communication.

### Steps to Integrate:

1. **Create a Rails Application**: Develop a Rails application for your social network, implementing the required features, and exposing necessary APIs.

2. **Develop an Obsidian Plugin**: Utilize Obsidianâ€™s API and your web development knowledge to create a plugin that interacts with your Rails application.

3. **Real-time Syncing**: Use websockets for real-time data syncing between Obsidian and your Rails application.

4. **Embed Web View**: Embed a simplified web view of your social network within Obsidian for direct interaction.

5. **Utilize Existing Plugins**: Integrate existing Obsidian plugins like "calendar" and "kanban" to manage schedules and tasks locally.

6. **Security Considerations**: Ensure secure communication between the plugin and your web application, considering authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

### Important Plugins for Inspiration:

- **Obsidian Git**: This plugin automatically backs up your Obsidian vault to a git repository, providing an example of regular syncing.
  
- **Obsidian Advanced URI**: Allows for interaction with Obsidian through custom URIs, demonstrating how external applications can communicate with Obsidian.

- **Templater**: Demonstrates dynamic content generation within Obsidian.

### Considerations:
- **Feasibility**: Building a fully-functional social network within Obsidian is quite challenging. Consider creating a simplified version that serves as a bridge between Obsidian and your web application.
  
- **Data Privacy**: Be mindful of data privacy and security, especially when syncing and storing user data.

- **User Experience**: Ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience within the constraints of Obsidianâ€™s interface.

Remember that Obsidian isn't designed as a platform for building social networks, so there might be limitations to what can be achieved. Nonetheless, with creativity and the right set of tools, you can create a system that leverages Obsidian for an enhanced knowledge-sharing experience.

How could my social network incorporate activity pub protocol? Would it make sense to integrate with the rails api?



Incorporating the ActivityPub protocol into your social network can be a good idea, as it's a decentralized social networking protocol that enhances the interoperability between different services and systems. It enables users on your social network to communicate and interact with users on other platforms that support ActivityPub, thereby expanding the reach and functionality of your application.

### How to Incorporate ActivityPub in Rails:

1. **ActivityPub Gem**: Consider using an existing ActivityPub library for Rails, like `activity_pub` gem, to handle the basic functionalities of the protocol.

2. **Inbox and Outbox**: Implement the Inbox and Outbox architecture in your Rails application. The Inbox is for receiving ActivityPub messages, and the Outbox is for sending them.

3. **Actors and Activities**: Create and manage Actors (users) and Activities (user actions) according to the ActivityPub specification.

4. **Routes and Controllers**: Set up the necessary routes and controllers to handle incoming ActivityPub requests and serve ActivityPub objects.

5. **Federation**: Implement federation to interact with other ActivityPub supporting platforms and servers.

### Integration with Rails API:

- **Endpoints**: Expose ActivityPub-specific endpoints in your Rails API for handling activities and actors.
  
- **Serialization**: Serialize your applicationâ€™s data into ActivityPub compliant JSON objects.

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for ActivityPub interactions.

- **Content Sharing**: Enable content sharing between your social network and other platforms through the ActivityPub protocol.

- **Real-time Updates**: Leverage WebSockets or similar technologies for real-time updates and notifications.

### Potential Benefits:

1. **Interoperability**: Users can interact with people across different platforms, breaking the barriers of individual social networks.
  
2. **Decentralization**: Decentralized architecture prevents reliance on a single server or service.

3. **User Engagement**: Increased user engagement by interacting with a wider audience.

4. **Content Discovery**: Helps in discovering and sharing content across different platforms.

### Considerations:

- **Complexity**: Incorporating ActivityPub can be complex, depending on your application's requirements and existing architecture.
  
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensure data privacy and security, especially when dealing with cross-platform interactions.

- **User Experience**: Strive for a seamless user experience within your social network while interacting with external platforms.

In conclusion, integrating ActivityPub with your Rails API for the social network could make sense if you aim to create an open, decentralized, and interoperable platform. It can add significant value, but itâ€™s important to weigh the benefits against the added complexity and development effort.

Tell me all relevant obsidian plug-ins and the services I could compete against by centralizing them in Obsidian. E.g.: Notion/Trello replaced by boards plugin , GitBook replaced by publish plugin, Google calendar, etc.

Obsidian offers a variety of plugins that enable users to centralize different functionalities, potentially replacing several standalone services. Hereâ€™s a list of relevant Obsidian plugins and the services they could potentially compete against:
