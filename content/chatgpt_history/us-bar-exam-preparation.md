Give me books and general recommendations to pass the USA bar exam and become a certified USA lawyer. I am mexican, no law background.

To pass the bar exam and become a certified lawyer in the United States, you first have to graduate from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). This requires a substantial investment in both time and money, usually totaling three years of full-time study. You must also pass the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) to be admitted to an ABA-accredited law school. 

Moreover, as an international student, you may need to complete a qualifying law degree in your home country or have significant legal experience before you can be admitted to a U.S. law school. 

The specific requirements for becoming a lawyer can vary from state to state, so it is advisable to check with the bar association in the state where you intend to practice. 

To prepare for law school and the bar exam, the following resources may be helpful:

1. **Law School Admission Test (LSAT) Preparation:**
   - The Official LSAT PrepTest series
   - The LSAT Trainer: A Remarkable Self-Study Guide For The Self-Driven Student by Mike Kim
   - Manhattan Prepâ€™s LSAT Strategy Guides

2. **Law School Materials:**
   - Getting To Maybe: How to Excel on Law School Exams by Richard Michael Fischl and Jeremy Paul
   - Law School Confidential: A Complete Guide to the Law School Experience by Robert H. Miller

3. **Bar Exam Preparation:**
   - Barbri Bar Review (multi-state)
   - Kaplan Bar Review (multi-state)
   - Emanuel Bar Review series (for essays, MBE, and MPT)
   - Strategies and Tactics for the MBE (Multistate Bar Exam) by Kimm Alayne Walton and Steve Emanuel

4. **American Legal System Understanding:**
   - The U.S. Constitution: A Reader by Hillsdale College Politics Faculty
   - An Introduction to the American Legal System by John M. Scheb
   - American Law 101: An Easy Primer on the U.S. Legal System by Sherri L. Burr

5. **General Legal Skills:**
   - Legal Writing in Plain English, Second Edition: A Text with Exercises by Bryan A. Garner
   - The Elements of Legal Style by Bryan A. Garner

Remember, your best bet would be to attend a law school in the U.S. if you're planning to practice there, because the curriculum will be tailored towards passing the bar exam. Also, please consider that even after you pass the bar exam, there may be additional steps before you can practice law in the U.S., such as background checks and character evaluations.

It is advisable to consult with legal professionals or educational consultants to get more tailored advice for your personal circumstances. In any case, a commitment to diligent study, strong understanding of legal principles, and developing analytical skills will be crucial to your success.

I canâ€™t join a US school. Can I simply prepare to take the certification?

Becoming a lawyer in the United States usually requires obtaining a Juris Doctor (JD) degree from a law school approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) before you can sit for the bar exam. This standard requirement might present challenges for those who cannot attend a U.S. law school.

However, there are a few states that do not strictly require a JD from an ABA-accredited law school. For instance, California allows you to sit for the bar exam if you have studied law in a law office or Judgeâ€™s chambers, or if you have graduated from a non-ABA-approved law school that is authorized by the state. Virginia and Vermont have similar rules.

If you're thinking of studying law in Mexico and then taking the bar exam in the United States, the process is more complex. The New York Bar allows foreign-trained lawyers to take the bar exam, provided they have a certain amount of legal education and/or experience, and it may require a specific program of study at an ABA-approved law school.

Still, you'll want to make sure you fully understand the bar admission requirements in the specific U.S. state where you intend to practice, because each state sets its own rules for bar admission.

To prepare for the bar exam, there are many resources available:

1. **Bar Exam Prep Courses:** These are comprehensive study programs that provide lectures, outlines, practice questions, and sometimes personalized feedback. Examples include Barbri, Kaplan, and Themis.

2. **Books:**
   - Strategies & Tactics for the MBE (Multistate Bar Exam) by Kimm Alayne Walton and Steve Emanuel
   - Emanuel Bar Review series (for essays, MBE, and MPT)

3. **Online Resources:** Websites like JD Advising provide free resources to help you prepare for the bar exam.

Keep in mind that the bar exam is designed to be challenging and to assess your understanding of U.S. law at a very high level. Without the foundational education provided by a law school, it will likely be extremely difficult. You'll need to be very disciplined and dedicated in your self-study.

Remember, even if you pass the bar exam, there may be additional steps before you can practice law in the U.S., such as background checks and character evaluations. Please consult with a legal professional or an educational consultant to get advice tailored to your personal circumstances.
