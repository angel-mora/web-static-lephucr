ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To provide you with the best advice, I would need to know a few more details about your financial situation and your business plans. Here are some questions that could help me understand your situation better:

1. **Income and Expenses**: What is your current income as a Ruby on Rails developer? What are your monthly expenses? This will help me understand your ability to pay off credit card debt.

2. **Current Debt**: Do you currently have any outstanding debt? If so, what is the interest rate on that debt? This can affect your ability to take on additional debt.

3. **Credit Score**: What is your current credit score? This can affect the interest rate you'll get on your credit card.

4. **Business Plan**: What is your business plan? How do you plan to use the credit card to help your business? For example, you mentioned hiring developers from Fiverr. Do you have a clear plan for how this will generate income?

5. **Risk Tolerance**: What is your risk tolerance? Are you comfortable taking on debt to invest in your business, or would you prefer a more conservative approach?

6. **AMEX Platinum Card Details**: What are the specific terms of the AMEX Platinum Card you've been offered? What is the interest rate, annual fee, and what rewards does it offer? 

As for using credit to hire developers and build MVPs (Minimum Viable Products), it's a common practice in the startup world. However, it's important to remember that it's a risk. If the MVPs don't generate income, you'll still have to pay off the credit card debt. It's also important to remember that hiring developers is just one part of building a successful product. You'll also need to invest time and money into market research, marketing, sales, and customer support. 

Finally, it's worth noting that the AMEX Platinum Card is often geared towards travelers, with benefits like access to airport lounges, hotel status upgrades, and travel insurance. If you don't travel frequently, you might not get the full value from this card. There might be other credit cards that are better suited to your needs, such as cards that offer cash back on business expenses. 

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making major financial decisions. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
