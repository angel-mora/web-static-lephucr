# Separate Webpack Docker Image

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I want to upgrade a rails app that uses docker. Is it advisable to have a separate image for webpack?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Yes, it's a common practice to have a separate Docker image for webpack in a Rails app. This helps to isolate the frontend dependencies and build process from the main application image, making it more modular and easier to manage. It also allows for better caching strategies during the Docker build process, optimizing development and deployment workflows.

Upgrading ruby or rails will break the connection with webpack?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Upgrading Ruby or Rails itself should not inherently break the connection with Webpack. However, it's crucial to consider potential changes in dependencies or configurations during the upgrade. Verify that your webpacker gem version aligns with your Rails version, and check for any updates or adjustments needed in your webpack configuration files. Careful testing and documentation can help mitigate issues during the upgrade process.
