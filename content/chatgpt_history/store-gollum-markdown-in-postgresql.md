Does it make sense to store a gollum based markdown with front matter as a postgres ruby on rails app? 

Storing Gollum-based Markdown with front matter in a PostgreSQL database for a Ruby on Rails application is feasible and can make sense depending on your specific use case. Here are some considerations:

1. **Integration with Rails**: Rails is a robust framework for web applications, and it integrates well with PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database. Storing Markdown content in PostgreSQL can leverage Rails' ActiveRecord for easy manipulation and querying of data.

2. **Version Control**: Gollum, a Git-based wiki system, excels at version control. If you want to maintain this functionality, you'll need to implement a versioning system in your Rails app, which can be more complex compared to Git's native capabilities.

3. **Front Matter Handling**: Front matter in Markdown files is commonly used for metadata. Rails can parse and store this metadata, but you'll need to design a schema in PostgreSQL to accommodate it.

4. **Rendering Markdown**: Rails will need a way to render Markdown to HTML for display. This can be achieved using Ruby libraries like Redcarpet or Kramdown.

5. **Search Functionality**: PostgreSQL supports full-text search, which can be beneficial if you need to search through Markdown content.

6. **Scalability and Performance**: PostgreSQL is well-suited for handling large amounts of data and offers good performance, which is beneficial if your application scales.

7. **Backup and Data Integrity**: Regular backups and data integrity checks are important, especially if you're moving away from a version-controlled system like Git.

In summary, while this setup might not be as straightforward as using Gollum with Git, it offers the benefits of integrating with a Rails web application, utilizing PostgreSQL's robust features, and customizing the system to your specific needs. Just be prepared for additional development work related to version control, Markdown rendering, and front matter processing.

Tell me potential benefits of using pg, tell me which js libraries would help me leverage markdown Metadata customization to avoid a lot of dB design overhead

Using PostgreSQL (PG) for your Ruby on Rails application, especially when dealing with Markdown content and its metadata, can provide several benefits:

1. **Advanced Data Types and Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL supports a variety of advanced data types and has powerful full-text search capabilities. This can be particularly useful for searching through Markdown content.

2. **JSON and JSONB Support**: PG's support for JSON and JSONB data types allows you to store structured metadata in a flexible format. This can reduce database design complexity, as you won't need to create separate tables or columns for each metadata field.

3. **Reliability and Scalability**: PostgreSQL is known for its high reliability, data integrity, and scalability. It can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for applications that may grow over time.

4. **Robust Community and Extensions**: There's a strong community around PostgreSQL, providing a wealth of extensions and tools. This can be invaluable for finding solutions or optimizations specific to your use case.

5. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant, ensuring reliable transaction processing, which is crucial for data integrity.

Regarding JavaScript libraries to leverage Markdown metadata customization and reduce database design overhead, consider the following:

1. **Remark**: Remark is a powerful Markdown processor powered by plugins. It can parse front matter and transform Markdown into various formats. You can use it to extract and manipulate metadata before sending it to your Rails backend.

2. **Gray-Matter**: This library is excellent for extracting front matter from Markdown files. It's straightforward to use and can parse various front matter formats, making it easy to handle metadata on the client side.

3. **Marked**: Marked is a Markdown parser and compiler. While it doesn't directly handle front matter, it can be combined with other libraries like Gray-Matter for a complete solution.

4. **Showdown**: A JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter, Showdown can be used alongside other libraries to handle Markdown rendering in the browser.

5. **Front-matter**: Specifically designed to extract front matter from Markdown files, this library is simple and focused, making it a good choice if you're only dealing with front matter extraction.

These libraries can help you process and extract metadata from Markdown on the client side, simplifying the data you send to your Rails backend and reducing the need for a complex database schema.
