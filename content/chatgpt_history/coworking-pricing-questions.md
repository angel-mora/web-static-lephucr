When inquiring about pricing at a coworking space, it's important to gather comprehensive information to understand what you're getting for your money and how it aligns with your needs. Here are several key questions you might consider asking:

1. **What are your membership plans and pricing?**
   - Ask for details on all available options, including part-time, full-time, private offices, and dedicated desks, to find the plan that best suits your needs.

2. **Is there a commitment period?**
   - Understand if there are any long-term commitments or if memberships are month-to-month.

3. **What amenities and services are included in the price?**
   - Clarify what is included, such as internet access, printing services, kitchen facilities, meeting rooms, etc.

4. **Are there any additional fees?**
   - Sometimes, there might be extra charges for booking conference rooms, using certain equipment, or other amenities.

5. **Do you offer any discounts for longer commitments or startups?**
   - Some coworking spaces provide discounts for upfront payments for longer terms or special rates for startups and non-profits.

7. **What is your policy on guests?**
   - If you expect to have clients or collaborators visit, it's important to know the policy on guests and if there are any associated costs.

   - Understand the terms for cancelling your membership, including any notice periods and penalties.

10. **Do you have a trial period?**
    - Some coworking spaces offer a trial period for you to experience the space before committing. 

11. **What is the community like?**
    - Understanding the type of professionals and industries represented in the coworking space can help you gauge if itâ€™s a good fit for networking and community building.
