ðŸ™‹ **You:**

Just following historical data, how much do you think Mastercard paid for the payments company Arcus (YC 2013) in the acquisition that happened between 2023 and 2024?

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

While the exact acquisition price for Mastercard's purchase of Arcus has not been publicly disclosed, we can make an informed estimation by considering historical data and similar acquisitions in the payments and fintech industry.

Given that Arcus was a Y Combinator company from the 2013 batch and focused on fintech, particularly in Latin America, we can compare it to other similar deals:

1. **Plaid's Acquisition by Visa**: In 2020, Visa attempted to acquire Plaid, a fintech company connecting banks and fintech apps, for about $5.3 billion. However, this deal was called off due to antitrust concerns.

2. **PayPal's Acquisition of Xoom**: PayPal acquired Xoom, a digital money transfer service, for $890 million in 2015.

3. **Mastercard's Acquisition of Finicity**: Mastercard acquired Finicity, another fintech focused on open banking, for $825 million in 2020.

Given Arcus' focus on payments and its potential to enhance Mastercard's position in Latin America, the acquisition price could likely fall between $500 million and $1 billion, depending on Arcus' growth, customer base, and strategic value to Mastercard.

However, this is purely speculative, and the actual number could vary. The price might also be lower if the deal focused more on technology acquisition rather than a large customer base or significant market share.
