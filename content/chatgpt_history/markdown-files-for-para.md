## ðŸ§  Full Chat


Apart from PROJECT, README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, what other markdown files capitalized my main projects folder under Obsidian-based PARA it should contain?

When you're organizing your project folder in Obsidian, especially using the PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method, the primary markdown files you might have are PROJECT, README, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING. However, depending on the nature and complexity of your project or the need for additional structure and documentation, here are some other markdown files you might consider:

1. **CHANGELOG.md**: A log of all the changes made in the project, including new features, bug fixes, and other updates. This helps keep track of project progress and communicates changes to others.

2. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: If you're working with a team or a community, this file can set expectations for behavior and outline the steps for reporting and handling inappropriate behavior.

3. **FAQ.md**: A list of Frequently Asked Questions and their answers, useful for onboarding new team members or for quick reference.

4. **GLOSSARY.md**: A list of terms and definitions related to the project. This is especially useful for projects in specialized domains where jargon can be a barrier to understanding.

5. **ROADMAP.md**: An overview of the planned features, improvements, and timelines. This provides a vision for where the project is headed.

6. **TEMPLATES.md**: If you often create similar notes or documents within the project, a templates file can speed up that process.

7. **METADATA.md**: Contains any key metadata about the project that isn't captured elsewhere. For example: important dates, version numbers, or other project-specific information.

8. **REFERENCES.md** or **BIBLIOGRAPHY.md**: A list of resources, articles, papers, or other materials that the project references or is built upon.

9. **GUIDELINES.md**: Best practices and guidelines specific to the project.

10. **TODO.md**: A list of tasks that need to be completed. While task management is usually better in a dedicated tool, a simple list can be useful for smaller projects or as a quick overview.

11. **SETUP.md** or **INSTALLATION.md**: Instructions on how to set up the project environment, dependencies, or any required configurations.

Remember, the goal of PARA and Obsidian is to help you create a structure that's clear and useful for you. You don't necessarily need all these files; they're just suggestions that you can adapt based on your needs. The key is to maintain clarity and ease of navigation, so you can efficiently access and understand your information.

associate with org mode flows and keywords. I am asking for a structure for the base 1. Projects folder. Every folder will contain its own structure, of course. I just want a bunch of files to put the things that are sort of projects but still not under a folder, just waiting for something else to happen.

Got it. If you're looking to integrate Obsidian's PARA structure with `org-mode` flows and keywords and focus on the Projects folder, then let's merge the two worlds. Here's a potential structure for the base level of your Projects folder in Obsidian, with an emphasis on `org-mode` style:

1. **PROJECT.org**: A high-level overview of the current projects you're working on. This can list out major milestones, dependencies, and responsibilities.

2. **TODO.org**: Incorporate the `org-mode` concept of TODO items. This is a list of tasks or items related to projects that need action but might not yet be associated with a specific project folder.

3. **INBOX.org**: Using the GTD concept, this can be where you quickly jot down project-related ideas, tasks, or notes to be processed and organized later.

4. **WAITING.org**: For tasks or projects that are waiting for some external event or input before they can proceed.

5. **SOMEDAY.org**: For projects or ideas you'd like to pursue someday but aren't currently active. This can be revisited during reviews to activate or delete ideas.

6. **AGENDA.org**: Inspired by `org-mode`'s agenda view. This can be a dynamic view or manual compilation of upcoming deadlines, milestones, or scheduled project-related tasks.

7. **ARCHIVE.org**: Completed or abandoned projects. This can be a list or brief notes about projects that you've archived.

8. **TAGS.org**: A list or dictionary of tags you use throughout your project notes. This can help you maintain consistency in your tagging.

9. **JOURNAL.org**: Periodic reflections on project progress, challenges, and insights. This can be weekly, monthly, or at any interval that makes sense for you.

10. **REFERENCES.org**: As in the earlier suggestion, a list of key resources, tools, readings, or external links relevant to multiple projects.

Remember, the real value comes from maintaining a structure that supports your workflow and thought process, so adjust these suggestions as needed. The integration of PARA with `org-mode` offers a powerful combination of structure and functionality, helping you navigate and manage projects efficiently.

show me the file tree of the 1. Projects folder and then show me a mock of some of the most important files that should live under 1. Projects/ folder

Alright, let's start with the file tree for the "1. Projects" folder, integrating some of the structures discussed earlier:

```
1. Projects/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT.org
â”œâ”€â”€ TODO.org
â”œâ”€â”€ INBOX.org
â”œâ”€â”€ WAITING.org
â”œâ”€â”€ SOMEDAY.org
â”œâ”€â”€ AGENDA.org
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVE.org
â”œâ”€â”€ TAGS.org
â”œâ”€â”€ JOURNAL.org
â””â”€â”€ REFERENCES.org
```

Now, let's provide a mock-up of the content for some of these files:

**PROJECT.org**
```
* Active Projects
** Project Alpha
   - Description: Revamping the company website.
   - Deadline: December 10, 2023
** Project Beta
   - Description: Market research for the new product line.
   - Deadline: November 15, 2023
```

**TODO.org**
```
* TODO Finalize design mockups for Project Alpha
* TODO Schedule meeting with Marketing for Project Beta insights
* TODO Review budget allocation for Q4 projects
```

**INBOX.org**
```
* Idea: Explore integration of AI tools in our product.
* Task: Update project management software.
* Note: Check the new market research tool competitors are using.
```

**WAITING.org**
```
* WAITING Feedback from Design team for Project Alpha mockups
  - Expected: October 10, 2023
* WAITING Approval for budget increase for Project Gamma
  - Expected: October 15, 2023
```

**AGENDA.org**
```
* October 7, 2023
  - Meeting with Project Alpha stakeholders
  - Finalize vendor contracts
* October 9, 2023
  - Review meeting for Project Beta progress
```

**REFERENCES.org**
```
* Books
  - "Effective Project Management" by Robert K. Wysocki
* Articles
  - "The Future of Digital Projects" in TechMag, September 2023
* Tools
  - Trello: Project management tool
  - Asana: Task management for teams
```

These are basic mocks, and they can be expanded with links, more meta information, tags, etc., as per your needs. This structure aims to provide a clean and organized approach to your projects, integrating the strengths of both PARA and `org-mode`.

I meant suggest a good filesystem flow considering the steps that org mode tags have (like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE). It should justify if uses a kanban obsidian template or different files, or any other innovative idea to handle the flow of activities under the projects folder. It should integrate well to my obsidian general para workflow (explain what is the role of INBOX.md/org in the flow)

Certainly! Incorporating the `org-mode` task statuses (TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE) into the Obsidian PARA structure within the context of a project's folder requires a bit of hybrid thinking. Using a Kanban approach can visually represent the progression of tasks, and this is achievable with Obsidian plugins or templates. 

Hereâ€™s how you can structure this:

### Filesystem Flow:

```
1. Projects/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ INBOX.org
â”œâ”€â”€ TODO.org
â”œâ”€â”€ IN_PROGRESS.org
â”œâ”€â”€ DONE.org
â””â”€â”€ ARCHIVE.org
```

### File Content Mocks and Flow:

**INBOX.org**
```
* Explore the possibility of expanding into the European market
* Look into potential collaborations with Brand X
* Investigate new software tools for data analytics
```

The `INBOX.org` is where tasks or ideas initially land, often captured on the fly. Think of this as your "catch-all" bucket.

**TODO.org**
```
* TODO Research potential European cities for expansion
* TODO Send an email proposal to Brand X for collaboration
* TODO Compare leading data analytics tools
```

Once you've reviewed your `INBOX.org` items and decided they need action, you move them to `TODO.org`. Here they get a clear task label, perhaps with more detailed sub-tasks or notes.

**IN_PROGRESS.org**
```
* IN PROGRESS Contact local consultants in potential European cities
  - Deadline: October 20, 2023
* IN PROGRESS Initial discussions with Brand X's business development team
```

When you start working on a task, it shifts to `IN_PROGRESS.org`. This indicates active tasks and can have deadlines, sub-tasks, or other relevant notes.

**DONE.org**
```
* DONE Decided against expanding to Paris after initial research
* DONE Conducted initial discussion with Brand X on September 25, 2023
```

Once a task is completed, it moves to `DONE.org`. You can also add a brief note about the result or any follow-up actions.

**ARCHIVE.org**
This file can be used for older tasks that are done but you want to keep for historical reference.

### Kanban Integration:

With the Obsidian Kanban plugin/template, you can transform this file-based flow into a board-style view. Each column on the board would represent a file (INBOX, TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE). 

1. You first add tasks or ideas to the **INBOX** column.
2. When reviewing and clarifying tasks, you drag them to **TODO**.
3. As you start working on a task, drag it to **IN PROGRESS**.
4. Upon completion, tasks move to **DONE**.

This Kanban approach, combined with `org-mode` statuses and the PARA method, gives a very structured and visual workflow. The combination ensures quick capture of ideas, a clear action path, a sense of progress, and a record of completed tasks.

Remember, the strength of tools like Obsidian lies in their flexibility. Adjust this proposed structure to what makes sense for you and your workflow!

and how are those lines that change the state move around in the separate kanban file?

If you're using a Kanban-style plugin or template in Obsidian, the movement of tasks between different states (e.g., from INBOX to TODO to IN PROGRESS to DONE) would be represented by dragging and dropping the task cards between columns. 

However, if you're using individual files for each state, the transition involves a manual process of moving content between files. This requires more work and can potentially disrupt the seamless workflow of a Kanban system.

Let's unify the two approaches: Use a single Kanban board (file) to visualize and manage the states, while maintaining the state-related file structure for reference or more detailed notes.

### Unified Approach:

1. **Projects_Kanban.org**: This file acts as your visual workflow board.
2. State-related files: INBOX.org, TODO.org, IN_PROGRESS.org, DONE.org

### Workflow:

1. **Capture**: You quickly jot down tasks or ideas into `INBOX.org` and also create a card for them in the **INBOX** column of `Projects_Kanban.org`.

2. **Review & Clarify**: During your review, you move tasks from the **INBOX** column to the **TODO** column in `Projects_Kanban.org`. Simultaneously, you transfer the tasks from `INBOX.org` to `TODO.org`.

3. **Act**: As you start on a task, drag it to the **IN PROGRESS** column on the Kanban board and move the corresponding task from `TODO.org` to `IN_PROGRESS.org`.

4. **Complete**: Upon completion, move the task to the **DONE** column on the Kanban board and transfer it from `IN_PROGRESS.org` to `DONE.org`.

The synchronization between the Kanban board and the state-related files requires manual intervention. This dual approach provides both a visual workflow (through the Kanban board) and a more detailed textual record (through the state-related files).

If you find this synchronization cumbersome, you may choose to lean more heavily on one approach or the other. The Kanban approach alone can be more streamlined, but the separate files can offer more detailed organization and note-taking. Choose the approach that best fits your workflow and the complexity of your projects.

suggest something simpler, an holistic approach, use your imagination to invent something creative that can be doable with obsidian plugins and to automate the most

Alright, let's simplify and innovate:

### A Unified Obsidian Workflow Using the "Tasks" Plugin

**1. `Projects_Tasks.org`** 

This singular file captures everything, utilizing the power of the "Tasks" plugin. This plugin manages tasks seamlessly, allowing for due dates, filtering, and more.

### File Structure:

```
1. Projects/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects_Tasks.org
â””â”€â”€ Archives/
    â””â”€â”€ Project_X_Archive.org (for archived projects/tasks)
```

### Workflow Inside `Projects_Tasks.org`:

```
# INBOX
- [ ] Explore the possibility of expanding into the European market :: #project-alpha
- [ ] Check new data analytics tools :: #research

# TODO
- [ ] Research potential European cities for expansion :: #project-alpha
- [ ] Send proposal to Brand X :: #project-beta 

# IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Contact consultants in European cities :: #project-alpha 

# DONE
- [x] Discussed potential with Brand X on September 25, 2023 :: #project-beta
```

**How it Works:**

1. **Capture in INBOX**: Jot down tasks or ideas quickly under the `INBOX` header.
2. **Transition States**: As tasks move between states, you can cut and paste them under the respective headers OR even better, using Obsidian's block embeds, reference them under the new header.
3. **Tagging for Context**: Use tags (like `#project-alpha`) for additional context or to group related tasks.

**Automation & Advantages with Plugins:**

1. **Tasks Plugin**: This plugin provides functionality to manage tasks with due dates, recurring tasks, filtering, etc. You can filter by tags (e.g., project names) or states (INBOX, TODO, etc.) and even set deadlines.

2. **QuickAdd Plugin**: It's a macro-like plugin that allows you to quickly capture tasks into your `Projects_Tasks.org` file without needing to open it. With a quick command, you can jot a task down into the `INBOX` section.

3. **Calendar Plugin**: Integrated with the Tasks plugin, visualize tasks on a calendar, offering a clearer view of deadlines and timelines.

4. **Slated Plugin**: For rescheduling tasks and automatically moving them around based on dates.

5. **Review & Archive**: Periodically, review the `DONE` section. Archive completed projects/tasks in the `Archives/` folder.

This approach:

- **Reduces File Shuffling**: No need to move between multiple files.
- **Centralizes Tasks**: Everything resides in a singular, holistic view.
- **Offers Visual and Textual Balance**: Through plugins, you get a good balance of a visual workflow (Calendar) and textual clarity (Tasks).
- **Enhances Speed**: QuickAdd enhances the speed of capturing tasks.

In this method, you are maximizing Obsidian's capability with a minimalistic approach, making project management smoother and more integrated.

are you missing kanban plugin itself?

Absolutely, the Kanban plugin for Obsidian is indeed a powerful tool to visually organize tasks within the Projects folder. My previous approach was to simplify the structure using the Tasks plugin primarily. But if you're looking for a seamless and more visual approach, the Kanban plugin is an excellent choice.

Let's reimagine this with the Kanban plugin:

### A Unified Obsidian Workflow Using the "Kanban" Plugin

**1. `Projects_Board.org`** 

This file is your visual Kanban board. Each column on the board would represent a state of your tasks (INBOX, TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE).

### File Structure:

```
1. Projects/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects_Board.org (Kanban board)
â””â”€â”€ Archives/
    â””â”€â”€ Project_X_Archive.org (for archived tasks or notes)
```

### Workflow Inside `Projects_Board.org`:

**Columns:**

- **INBOX**
  - Capture tasks or ideas quickly.
- **TODO**
  - Tasks that need action.
- **IN PROGRESS**
  - Tasks you are currently working on.
- **DONE**
  - Completed tasks.

**How it Works:**

1. **Capture in INBOX**: Quickly add cards to the `INBOX` column.
2. **Transition States**: Simply drag cards between columns as tasks progress.
3. **Tagging for Context**: Use tags (like `#project-alpha`) directly on the cards for additional context or to group related tasks.

**Automation & Advantages with Plugins:**

1. **Kanban Plugin**: The heart of this approach. It allows for easy visual management of tasks. You can set up due dates, add tags, and even archive completed cards.

2. **QuickAdd Plugin**: Use it to quickly capture tasks directly into the `INBOX` column of your `Projects_Board.org` Kanban without opening the board.

3. **Calendar Plugin**: For a different perspective, visualize due dates of tasks/cards on a calendar.

4. **Review & Archive**: Periodically, drag completed cards in the `DONE` column to an archive or move them to the `Archives/` folder if you need a detailed historical record.

This approach:

- **Enhances Visual Workflow**: The Kanban board offers a clear visual representation of task states.
- **Centralizes Tasks**: All tasks reside on one board, offering a clear overview.
- **Maintains Simplicity**: Avoids shuffling between multiple files.
- **Integrates Seamlessly**: With Obsidian's ecosystem and other plugins.

In this method, the Kanban plugin stands as the primary tool for project management, offering an intuitive and effective system within Obsidian.

now suggest an approach of kanban mixed with CAPITALIZED files for the rest of the PARA folders, I want to see a tree in the explanation

Certainly! We can integrate a Kanban-style workflow into the entirety of the PARA system, bringing visual project/task management to each part of it.

Here's a breakdown of how the system might look:

### Filesystem Tree:

```
Obsidian_Vault/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 1. PROJECTS/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECTS_Board.org (Main Kanban board for projects)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_A/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_A.org (Notes and details)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PROJECT_A_Board.org (Kanban board specific to Project A)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PROJECT_B/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_B.org
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ PROJECT_B_Board.org
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 2. AREAS/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AREAS_Board.org (Main Kanban board for areas of responsibility)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AREA_1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AREA_1.org (Notes and details)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AREA_1_Board.org (Kanban board specific to Area 1)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AREA_2/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ AREA_2.org
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ AREA_2_Board.org
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 3. RESOURCES/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RESOURCES_Board.org (Main Kanban board for resource tracking)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RESOURCE_1.org
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RESOURCE_2.org
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ 4. ARCHIVES/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVES_Board.org (Main Kanban board for archiving)
    â””â”€â”€ OLD_PROJECT.org
```

### Explanation:

1. **PROJECTS**:
   - `PROJECTS_Board.org` is your primary Kanban board to visually oversee all projects.
   - Each individual project (like `PROJECT_A`) can have its specific Kanban board (`PROJECT_A_Board.org`) to manage tasks within that project.

2. **AREAS**:
   - `AREAS_Board.org` provides a visual representation of your areas of responsibility or focus.
   - Individual areas (like `AREA_1`) can also have their specific Kanban board (`AREA_1_Board.org`) to manage specific tasks or sub-areas.

3. **RESOURCES**:
   - `RESOURCES_Board.org` is a visual tool to track and manage resources. This can be a bit different since resources aren't typically managed in a task-like fashion. However, if you often update or reorganize resources, this board can visualize that workflow. You might have columns like "To Review", "In Use", "To Archive", etc.
   - Each resource is a file containing information, links, notes, etc. about that particular resource.

4. **ARCHIVES**:
   - `ARCHIVES_Board.org` is where completed, outdated, or inactive tasks, projects, and resources move for historical purposes. It can visualize what's been recently archived or what might need a revisit.

**Workflow**:

The workflow is visually driven by the Kanban boards, supplemented by the detailed note files:

1. **Capture**: Use `QuickAdd` or directly add cards to the `INBOX` column of the relevant board.
2. **Review & Clarify**: Periodically review the `INBOX`, refining tasks or moving them to relevant columns or boards.
3. **Act & Update**: As you progress, move cards through the columns, indicating their state.
4. **Complete & Archive**: Completed tasks or outdated information can be moved to `ARCHIVES`.

Using this setup, you enjoy both a detailed file-based system and a visual Kanban-style workflow for each segment of the PARA structure.

Should I have my kanban based on /PROJECT.md or /4. Project/PROJECT.md? I mean, according to Tiago Forte how sould I handle my life daily todos? Through projects or how?



Tiago Forte's PARA system is designed primarily for organizing information and projects. In his framework, the "Projects" category is typically reserved for initiatives or endeavors with clear outcomes and end-dates. That said, daily tasks or life todos might not always fit neatly into this definition. 

### Daily Todos in PARA:

In the PARA framework, there are two primary places where you might place your daily tasks:

1. **Projects**:
   - If a daily task is clearly associated with a specific project you're working on, it would reside within that project.
   - For instance, if you have a project called "Website Redesign", a task like "Choose new color scheme" is clearly part of that project and should be housed there.
   - Your structure would be something like `/1. Projects/Website Redesign.org` or simply `/1. Projects/Website Redesign.md`.

2. **Areas**:
   - The "Areas" category in PARA encompasses areas of your life or work in which you want to maintain a certain standard over time without necessarily having a clear end-date. This might include health, relationships, ongoing job responsibilities, etc.
   - Daily tasks or routines that don't tie directly to a specific project but are part of your ongoing responsibilities or life areas might fit best here.
   - For instance, a task like "Gym workout" might reside in an area called "Health" or "Fitness".
   - Your structure could be `/2. Areas/Health.org` or `/2. Areas/Health.md`.

### Integrating a Kanban Workflow:

If you want to use a Kanban-style approach for daily todos:

1. **Centralized Daily Kanban**:
   - Create a central "Daily Tasks" Kanban board at the root of your vault or within a dedicated folder. This board can be used specifically for tasks you intend to tackle today or this week.
   - You can structure it as `/Daily_Tasks.org` or even within an area like `/2. Areas/Daily Life/Daily_Tasks.org`.

2. **Project-Specific or Area-Specific Kanban**:
   - If you prefer to have a visual representation for each project or area, then place a Kanban board within each project or area folder.
   - This way, you can visually track tasks specific to that project or area.

### In Summary:

While Tiago Forte's PARA method provides a structure for organizing information, how you handle daily tasks depends largely on your personal preference and the nature of those tasks. If they're directly tied to specific projects, place them under "Projects". If they're more routine or ongoing responsibilities, they might fit better under "Areas".

The integration of a Kanban board, be it centralized for daily tasks or distributed among projects/areas, offers a visual way to manage and prioritize these tasks within the PARA framework.

So how can I use tags to keep track of areas using markdown in my daily logs?

Using tags to keep track of areas in your daily logs within markdown is a powerful way to interlink the conceptual structure of PARA, especially the "Areas" component, with your daily activities. Here's how you can effectively use tags for this purpose:

### 1. Define Your Areas:
First, list out the main areas of your life or work you want to track. Examples could be:
- #Health
- #Work
- #Learning
- #Relationships

### 2. Integrate Tags in Daily Logs:
When you're making daily logs or notes, simply add the relevant tag to any task, note, or reflection that pertains to one of these areas. Here's an example of what a daily log might look like:

```markdown
## 2023-10-29 - Daily Log

- Morning meditation [15 mins] #Health
- Conference call with the marketing team #Work
- Read a chapter from "Deep Work" #Learning
- Dinner with Alex #Relationships

## Reflections:
Felt very productive today, especially during the conference call where we outlined the next month's strategy. #Work

The meditation in the morning really helped in setting the right mood for the day. #Health
```

### 3. Use Obsidian's Search and Tag Pane:
Obsidian provides a tag pane on the right-hand side, allowing you to see all tags used in your notes. You can click on a specific tag, and Obsidian will show you all notes containing that tag. This way, if you click on #Health, you'll be able to see all daily logs or notes related to health.

### 4. Review and Reflect:
Periodically, perhaps weekly or monthly, click on each tag in Obsidian's tag pane to review your activities and reflections related to each area. This will give you a holistic view of how you're attending to each area and what changes or improvements you might need to make.

### 5. Enhance with Plugins:
There are plugins in Obsidian that enhance the tagging experience:

- **Tag Wrangler**: Helps in renaming, deleting, or aliasing tags.
- **Dataview**: Allows you to create queries based on tags, and you can make tables or lists out of the data.

### Tips:

1. **Consistency**: Be consistent in your tagging. Decide whether you'll use singular or plural forms, or if you'll prefix all area tags with a certain symbol or keyword.
   
2. **Hierarchical Tags**: Obsidian supports hierarchical tags. For example, #Work/Meeting and #Work/Emails. This can further categorize tasks or notes within an area.

3. **Don't Over-Tag**: While tagging is useful, adding too many tags to a single entry can be overwhelming and counterproductive. Aim for clarity and simplicity.

Incorporating tags related to areas in your daily logs helps bridge the gap between the high-level organization structure (like PARA) and the granular day-to-day activities, making the system more actionable and reflective.
