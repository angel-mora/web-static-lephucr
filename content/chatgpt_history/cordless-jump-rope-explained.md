Saw once some kind of jumping rope but it was just moving the rope without impact, how is it called?



What youâ€™re referring to is often called a **cordless jump rope**, **ropeless jump rope**, or **weighted handle jump rope**. Instead of a full rope, it has short cords or weighted balls attached to the handles. These simulate the motion of jumping rope without the actual rope, making it great for low-impact workouts, small spaces, or for avoiding tripping on a rope.

Itâ€™s popular for cardio training, coordination improvement, and can be a great option if you want to avoid impact on your joints while still getting a similar calorie burn to traditional jump roping.

No, it was like moving the rope heavily without jumping 

Ah, I see! What you're describing sounds like a **battle rope** workout. Battle ropes are thick, heavy ropes that are anchored to a point on the ground. Instead of jumping, you move the ropes in various ways (e.g., slamming, waving, or whipping motions) to engage your muscles and get a full-body workout. 

This kind of exercise is excellent for building strength, endurance, and coordination while also being low-impact on the joints. Itâ€™s commonly used in functional fitness, HIIT, and strength training routines.

No, it is with a jumping rope and mimics the jumping part

Ah, now I understand! Youâ€™re likely referring to a **weighted jump rope training system** where the focus is on **rope dragging or swinging** to mimic the jumping rope motion but without the actual jumping. These systems often use **heavy jump ropes** or **drag ropes** that are specifically designed to create resistance as you swing them, emphasizing upper body strength and conditioning rather than traditional jumping.

If itâ€™s purely a motion-based tool without impact, you might also be thinking of a **rope flow rope** (or flow rope). These ropes are designed to mimic the circular motion of jumping rope while focusing on smooth, controlled movements without jumping, improving mobility and rhythm. 

Let me know if youâ€™d like suggestions for specific tools or training systems!
