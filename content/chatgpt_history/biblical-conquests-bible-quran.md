Que cosas dicen la biblia o el coran sobre lo que se hace al conquistar una ciudad? 

The Bible contains various passages that describe the capture of cities. Here are a few examples:

1. David captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and established it as the city of David, building the city from the Millo and inward【8†source】.
2. Joab captured the royal city of Rabbah of the Ammonites【9†source】.
3. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, captured and burned the city of Gezer, killed its inhabitants, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife【10†source】.
4. Hazael, king of Aram, captured the city of Gath and then threatened Jerusalem【11†source】.
5. The king of Assyria captured several cities in Israel and exiled their people to Assyria【12†source】【13†source】【14†source】.

For information from the Quran regarding the conquest of cities, I would need to conduct another search to find specific verses and interpretations. Would you like me to do that?

En que otros lugares se pensó un territorio para el pueblo judío después de la guerra? 

After World War II, there were a few proposals for establishing a territory for the Jewish people:

1. **British Uganda Proposal**: In 1903, the British government offered a portion of East Africa for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. However, this proposal was later declined by the Zionist Congress due to the land being unsuitable and already inhabited by the Maasai people【24†source】.

2. **Jewish Autonomous Oblast**: The Soviet Union established the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Russian Far East in 1934. This was part of Stalin’s national policy, offering cultural autonomy to various national groups within a socialist framework. The area had harsh geography and climate, and the initiative eventually lost momentum, especially after World War II and the establishment of Israel【25†source】.

3. **Fugu Plan**: During the 1930s, Japan considered a plan to settle Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe in its territories. This plan, however, was never fully implemented due to various geopolitical events including Japan's alliances during World War II【26†source】.

4. **Madagascar Plan**: The Nazi government of Germany also briefly contemplated the forced relocation of European Jews to Madagascar. This idea was not unique to Nazi Germany and had been considered by various governments before, but it was never put into action and was instead used as a propaganda tool by the Nazis【27†source】. 

These alternatives to the eventual establishment of Israel in Palestine show the complex and often politically charged considerations for a Jewish homeland in the early 20th century.
