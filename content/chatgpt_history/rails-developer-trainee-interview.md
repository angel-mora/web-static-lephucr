questions to ask to a potential trainee from computer science. I am a experienced rails developer



When interviewing a potential trainee from a computer science background, it's important to gauge their fundamental knowledge, problem-solving skills, and understanding of web development concepts, especially those relevant to Ruby on Rails. Here are some questions you might consider asking:

### Technical Knowledge
1. **Fundamentals**
   - Can you explain the difference between object-oriented programming and functional programming?
   - What are the four main principles of object-oriented programming?
   - How do you handle error management in your code?

2. **Ruby and Rails Specific**
   - What is Ruby on Rails, and what are its main advantages?
   - Can you explain the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture?
   - How does Rails handle database migrations?
   - What are some of the most common Rails commands you use in the terminal?

3. **Web Development**
   - Can you explain how HTTP requests and responses work?
   - What is REST, and why is it important in web development?
   - How do you manage state in a web application?

4. **Database**
   - What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?
   - How do you design a database schema for a new application?
   - How would you optimize a slow-running SQL query?

### Problem-Solving and Coding Skills
1. **Coding Challenges**
   - Give them a simple coding problem to solve in Ruby.
   - Ask them to explain their thought process as they solve a problem.

2. **Debugging**
   - Provide them with a piece of buggy code and ask them to identify and fix the issues.

### Practical Experience and Projects
1. **Experience**
   - What projects have you worked on in the past, either as part of your coursework or on your own?
   - Can you walk me through a challenging bug you encountered and how you resolved it?
   - How do you keep your skills up to date with the latest developments in web development?

2. **Code Review**
   - Show them a snippet of code and ask them to review it. What improvements would they suggest?

### Soft Skills and Work Habits
1. **Collaboration**
   - How do you handle working in a team, especially when there are conflicting ideas?
   - Can you describe a situation where you had to collaborate with others to complete a project?

2. **Learning and Adaptability**
   - How do you approach learning a new technology or framework?
   - Can you give an example of a time when you had to quickly adapt to a new technology or work environment?

3. **Work Ethic**
   - How do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple deadlines to meet?
   - What do you do when you encounter a problem you can't solve on your own?

These questions should help you assess the trainee's technical abilities, problem-solving skills, and fit within your team and work culture.
