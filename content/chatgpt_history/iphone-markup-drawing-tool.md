ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The iPhone has a built-in drawing tool called **Markup**. You can use it to draw, add shapes, text, and even sign documents directly within apps like Photos, Notes, and Mail. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. **In Photos**: Open a photo, tap **Edit**, then tap the **Markup** icon (a pen inside a circle). Youâ€™ll have various tools like pens, markers, erasers, and colors.

2. **In Notes**: Open a note, tap the **Markup** icon at the bottom (pen symbol), and you can start drawing. This is helpful for adding sketches or annotations directly to your notes.

3. **In Mail**: When composing or replying to an email, you can use Markup by tapping the **Attachment** icon and selecting **Markup and Reply** to annotate images or PDFs.

4. **Screenshots**: After taking a screenshot, tap on the preview in the corner to bring up Markup.

This tool is useful for quick sketches, notes, or marking up photos and documents without needing an external app.
