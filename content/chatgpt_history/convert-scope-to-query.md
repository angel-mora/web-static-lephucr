can you help me convert these queries imto plain active record? 
scope :by_campaign_status, ->(status) { joins(:campaign).where(campaigns: { campaign_status: status }) }

Certainly! To convert the given scope into plain ActiveRecord queries in Ruby on Rails, you would use a similar approach but without the lambda syntax (`->`). Here's how you could rewrite the `by_campaign_status` scope as a plain ActiveRecord query:

```ruby
# Assuming `status` is the campaign status you want to filter by
status = 'your_desired_status' # Replace with the actual status you want

# The ActiveRecord query equivalent to your scope
result = YourModel.joins(:campaign).where(campaigns: { campaign_status: status })
```

In this conversion:

1. Replace `YourModel` with the actual model name where this scope is defined.
2. Set `status` to the desired campaign status you want to filter by.

This query will function the same as your scope, joining with the `campaign` model and filtering records based on the specified `campaign_status`.

scope :by_category, ->(category_id) { joins(:campaign).where(campaigns: { category_id: category_id}) }

To convert the `by_category` scope into a plain ActiveRecord query in Ruby on Rails, you will follow a similar approach as with the previous example. Here's the conversion:

```ruby
# Assuming `category_id` is the category ID you want to filter by
category_id = 123 # Replace with the actual category ID

# The ActiveRecord query equivalent to your scope
result = YourModel.joins(:campaign).where(campaigns: { category_id: category_id })
```

In this conversion:

1. Replace `YourModel` with the actual name of the model where this scope is being used.
2. Set `category_id` to the specific category ID you wish to filter by.

This query will effectively join the `YourModel` with the `campaign` model and filter the records where the `campaigns` table's `category_id` matches the specified `category_id`.

you didn't give me the last query in active records?

My apologies for the confusion. To rewrite the `by_category` scope as a plain ActiveRecord query, you would use the following format:

```ruby
# Assuming you have a variable `category_id` that holds the category ID you want to filter by
category_id = 123 # Replace 123 with the actual category ID

# The ActiveRecord query equivalent to your scope
result = YourModel.joins(:campaign).where(campaigns: { category_id: category_id })
```

In this example:

1. Replace `YourModel` with the name of the actual model where you are implementing this query.
2. Set `category_id` to the desired category ID for which you want to filter.

This query performs a join with the `campaign` association and filters the records based on the `category_id` in the `campaigns` table, matching it with the provided `category_id`.

how about this one into active records?
select * from categories join category_features on categories.id = categories.id;



The SQL query you've provided seems to contain a small error in the join condition. It should typically join on different columns from the two tables. Assuming you meant to join `categories.id` with `category_features.category_id`, here's how you would write this as an ActiveRecord query in Ruby on Rails:

```ruby
result = Category.joins('JOIN category_features ON categories.id = category_features.category_id')
```

In this ActiveRecord query:

- `Category` represents the model corresponding to the `categories` table.
- The `joins` method is used with a raw SQL fragment to specify the join condition: `categories.id = category_features.category_id`.

This query will join the `categories` table with the `category_features` table where the `id` of a category matches the `category_id` in the `category_features` table. If the join condition is different, you should adjust the `ON` clause accordingly.

can you change the query onve is correct from sql to activerecords?

Absolutely. If the correct SQL query is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories JOIN category_features ON categories.id = category_features.category_id;
```

Then, the equivalent in ActiveRecord would be:

```ruby
result = Category.joins(:category_features)
```

In this ActiveRecord query:

1. `Category` is the model that corresponds to your `categories` table.
2. `.joins(:category_features)` is used to join the `categories` table with the `category_features` table. This assumes that you have set up the appropriate association in your `Category` model, typically something like `has_many :category_features`.

This will perform an inner join between `categories` and `category_features` based on the associations defined in your Rails models. Remember, for this to work, you should have a `has_many :category_features` association defined in your `Category` model, and a corresponding `belongs_to :category` association in your `CategoryFeature` model.

regex for vscode to find all Rspec.describe MODULE::, where module can be any string camel cased

To create a regex pattern in VSCode that matches all instances of `Rspec.describe MODULE::`, where `MODULE` can be any camel-cased string, you can use the following regular expression:

```
Rspec\.describe\s+([A-Z][a-zA-Z]+::)
```

Here's what each part of the regex does:

- `Rspec\.describe`: Matches the literal string `Rspec.describe`. The backslash before the dot is necessary because the dot is a special character in regex, and we want to match it literally.
- `\s+`: Matches one or more whitespace characters.
- `([A-Z][a-zA-Z]+::)`: This is a capture group that matches a camel-cased string followed by `::`.
  - `[A-Z]`: Matches a single uppercase letter (the start of the camel-cased word).
  - `[a-zA-Z]+`: Matches one or more uppercase or lowercase letters (the rest of the camel-cased word).
  - `::`: Matches the literal `::` characters.

To use this regex in VSCode, you would open the search (Ctrl + F or Cmd + F on Mac), enable the regular expression option (usually a `.*` icon), and then enter the regex into the search bar. This should find all instances in your code that match this pattern.
