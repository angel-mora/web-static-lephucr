Best way to keep my bookmarks in phone and multiple computers synced

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To keep your bookmarks synced across your phone and multiple computers, consider using one of the following methods:

### 1. **Browser Sync Features**
   - **Google Chrome**: Use the built-in sync feature. Log into Chrome with the same Google account on all your devices. It syncs bookmarks, history, passwords, and more.
   - **Mozilla Firefox**: Similar to Chrome, Firefox allows you to sync bookmarks, tabs, passwords, and history across devices when you log into your Firefox account.
   - **Microsoft Edge**: Offers sync features similar to Chrome and Firefox, syncing bookmarks, history, and more across devices using your Microsoft account.
   - **Safari**: If youâ€™re in the Apple ecosystem, Safari can sync bookmarks across iPhones, iPads, and Macs using iCloud.

### 2. **Third-Party Bookmarking Services**
   - **Pinboard.in**: A simple and powerful bookmarking service that allows you to save bookmarks and access them from any device. You can tag, annotate, and even use it offline with some apps.
   - **Raindrop.io**: A visually rich bookmark manager with a cross-platform app. It allows for organization with tags, collections, and the ability to sync across devices.
   - **Pocket**: Primarily for saving articles, but it can also serve as a bookmark manager. It has apps and browser extensions for syncing across devices.

### 3. **Bookmark Managers with Cloud Sync**
   - **Diigo**: A robust tool for bookmarking, annotating, and sharing. It syncs across devices and has features for collaboration and research.
   - **Evernote or Notion**: Both are not dedicated bookmark managers but can be used to clip and organize links, and they sync across devices. Notion offers better structure for organization if you prefer detailed notes along with your bookmarks.

### 4. **Self-Hosted Solutions**
   - **Floccus**: An open-source extension that allows you to sync your bookmarks across browsers and devices using your own WebDAV server or Nextcloud instance.
   - **Nextcloud Bookmarks**: If you already have a Nextcloud server, you can use its bookmark app to sync bookmarks across devices.

### 5. **Custom Solution**
   - **Bookmark Export/Import via Rails Project**: Since youâ€™re working on a project to convert bookmarks into markdown articles for Obsidian, you could extend this to sync bookmarks by exporting them regularly and syncing the markdown files across devices using a service like Dropbox or Git.

**Best Choice:** If you want a straightforward and seamless solution, using your browser's built-in sync feature (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) or a third-party service like Raindrop.io would likely be the most effective. For more customization, a self-hosted solution like Floccus might be more appealing.

How can I migrate pinboard.in to google bookmarks?

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Migrating bookmarks from Pinboard.in to Google Bookmarks requires exporting your bookmarks from Pinboard and importing them into Google Bookmarks. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Export Bookmarks from Pinboard.in
1. **Log into Pinboard.in**: Open Pinboard.in and log in to your account.
2. **Export Bookmarks**:
   - Navigate to the [Export](https://pinboard.in/export/) page.
   - Select **HTML** as the export format.
   - Click on the **Export** button to download your bookmarks as an HTML file.

### Step 2: Prepare Google Bookmarks for Import
Unfortunately, Google Bookmarks was discontinued in September 2021, so direct migration to Google Bookmarks is no longer possible. However, if youâ€™re looking to import them into another Google service, like **Google Chrome**, follow the steps below.

### Step 3: Import Bookmarks into Google Chrome
1. **Open Google Chrome** on your computer.
2. **Access the Bookmarks Manager**:
   - Click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of Chrome.
   - Go to **Bookmarks** > **Bookmark manager**.
3. **Import Bookmarks**:
   - Click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the Bookmark Manager.
   - Select **Import bookmarks**.
   - Choose the HTML file you exported from Pinboard.in.
   - Chrome will import all your bookmarks from the HTML file.

### Step 4: Sync Bookmarks with Your Google Account
1. **Sign in to Chrome**:
   - If you haven't already, sign in to Chrome with your Google account.
2. **Enable Sync**:
   - Click the profile icon in the top-right corner of Chrome.
   - Ensure that **Sync** is turned on. This will sync your bookmarks across all devices where you use Chrome.

### Alternative: Import to Another Bookmark Manager
If you prefer not to use Google Chrome or are looking for an alternative, you can import the HTML file into another service like **Raindrop.io** or **Diigo**. These services often offer more advanced features and cross-platform support.

### Summary
While direct migration to Google Bookmarks isn't possible due to its discontinuation, importing your Pinboard bookmarks into Google Chrome provides a seamless way to keep them synced across all your devices through your Google account.
