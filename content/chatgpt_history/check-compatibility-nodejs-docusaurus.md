[INFO] Docusaurus version: 2.4.1
Node version: v18.18.0

It seems like you are trying to run a Docusaurus development server, but encountering an error related to the absence of a `docs` folder for the "current" version. Docusaurus expects a `docs` folder to be present in your project directory, containing the markdown files for your documentation.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if the `docs` Folder Exists
Ensure that the `docs` folder exists in the root of your project directory. If it doesnâ€™t exist, you will need to create it and add some documentation markdown files.

### 2. Check the Path
Make sure that the path to the `docs` folder is correctly configured in your `docusaurus.config.js` file. If you have a custom folder name or path, update the `docs` plugin configuration accordingly.

### 3. Check Versioning
If you are using versioning, ensure that the version labeled as "current" exists in the versioned_docs directory. If not, you might need to adjust the versioning configuration or add the necessary version.

### 4. Upgrade Docusaurus
You are using Docusaurus version 2.4.1. Consider upgrading to the latest version of Docusaurus, as the issue might be related to a bug that has been fixed in a newer release. You can upgrade Docusaurus by running:

```sh
npm install @docusaurus/core@latest @docusaurus/preset-classic@latest
```

### 5. Check Node Version
You are using Node version v18.18.0. While this is a relatively new version, ensure that it is compatible with the Docusaurus version you are using. If not, consider using an LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.

After following these steps, try running the development server again with:

```sh
npm run start
```

If the error persists, you might want to check the Docusaurus documentation or GitHub issues for additional information or solutions.

how can i check compatibility?

Checking compatibility between different software packages or libraries can be done through several methods:

### 1. **Official Documentation:**
   - **Docusaurus:** Check the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) for any information on supported Node.js versions.
   - **Node.js:** Similarly, review the [Node.js release documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) to understand which versions are currently supported or in maintenance.

### 2. **Release Notes/Changelog:**
   - Review the release notes or changelog of Docusaurus on their [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases). This can sometimes include information on breaking changes, deprecated features, or updated requirements.

### 3. **Community Forums/Issues:**
   - Search or ask questions on community forums like Stack Overflow, or check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues) for Docusaurus for any reported compatibility issues or discussions.

### 4. **Testing:**
   - If you canâ€™t find specific information on compatibility, you can test Docusaurus with different Node.js versions in a controlled environment (e.g., a virtual machine or a container) to see if any issues arise.

### 5. **Dependency Management Tools:**
   - Tools like npm will often warn you if you are trying to install a package that has unmet peer dependencies, including incompatible Node.js versions.

### 6. **Node.js Compatibility:**
   - Most Node.js libraries and frameworks maintain compatibility with Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) versions. If you are using a non-LTS version of Node.js, you might encounter more compatibility issues.

### 7. **Contacting Maintainers:**
   - If all else fails, you can try reaching out to the maintainers of Docusaurus directly, either through GitHub, community forums, or other contact methods they provide.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine whether the version of Docusaurus you are using is compatible with your Node.js version, and make any necessary adjustments.
