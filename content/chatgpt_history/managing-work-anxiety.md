Tell me good reasons to quit porn (what they call PMO) and weed so I can recall them every time I crave

Sure, here are some reasons for quitting PMO (Pornography, Masturbation, and Orgasm) and weed that you can recall when you have cravings.

Quitting PMO:
1. **Improved Mental Health:** Regular consumption of pornography can sometimes lead to depression, anxiety, and lowered self-esteem.
2. **Improved Sexual Health:** Quitting PMO can lead to healthier sexual relationships and might improve sexual dysfunction issues which can be induced by porn addiction.
3. **Increased Focus:** The time and energy spent on PMO can be refocused on productive tasks, improving overall productivity.
4. **Better Self-Control:** Overcoming PMO can help develop discipline and self-control, qualities useful in many areas of life.

Quitting Weed:
1. **Enhanced Cognitive Abilities:** Regular marijuana use can impair short-term memory, learning, and coordination. Quitting can help restore these cognitive abilities.
2. **Better Physical Health:** Quitting weed can lead to improvements in lung health and a decreased risk of lung infections.
3. **Financial Savings:** Weed can be expensive. By quitting, you can save a considerable amount of money.
4. **Improved Motivation:** Regular use of marijuana can lead to a decrease in motivation and interest in activities. By quitting, you can regain this motivation.

Always remember, it's crucial to seek professional help if you're struggling with addiction. These steps can be challenging, and a professional can provide guidance and resources to make the journey easier.

Tips to handle porn craving

Handling cravings for pornography can be challenging, but here are some strategies you might find helpful:

1. **Mindfulness:** Be aware of your triggers and emotions. When a craving hits, take a moment to pause, breathe, and observe your feelings

I am a programmer so I tend to spend a lot of time in front of a computer and smartphone

That's understandable. As a programmer, you're often required to spend long hours in front of screens which can make the situation a bit more challenging. However, there are strategies you can implement:

1. **Workplace Control:** Keep your work environment professional. If possible, work in an open space or around other people. 

2. **Breaks and Physical Activity:** Take regular breaks from screen time to engage in physical activity. This not only helps with your physical health, but also clears your mind and reduces stress.

3. **Online Filters and Blockers:** Use website blockers to restrict access to pornographic sites. This can act as a preventive measure when you're surfing the web.

4. **Constructive Distractions:** Find a hobby or activity you enjoy, such as coding a personal project, reading, gaming, or any other interest that can keep your mind occupied.

5. **Digital Detox:** Schedule regular time off screens. This could be a designated time each day or a full day each week. Use this time to engage in offline activities.

6. **Support Networks:** Join online or offline support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others going through similar challenges. 

7. **Professional Help:** If cravings become overwhelming, it might be helpful to speak to a mental health professional who can provide strategies and techniques tailored to your needs.

Provide concrete conductual strategies to handle the craving

Absolutely, here are some concrete behavioral strategies to manage cravings:

1. **Delay Technique:** When you feel a craving coming on, delay your response. Tell yourself you'll wait 15-30 minutes before acting on the urge. Often, the craving will pass in this timeframe.

2. **Urge Surfing:** This is a mindfulness technique where you observe your craving as a wave that rises, peaks, and eventually crashes. By observing it without judgement, you can watch it fade away without giving in.

3. **Replacement Activity:** Have a list of healthy, engaging activities you can immediately turn to when you feel a craving. This could be something physical like doing push-ups, or something mental like solving a puzzle or coding a quick function.

4. **Visualize Success:** Picture yourself successfully managing the craving. Visualization can help reinforce your determination and strengthen your resistance.

5. **Journaling:** Write down your feelings and thoughts when a craving occurs. This can help you understand your triggers and plan for future occurrences.

6. **Support Call:** Have a friend, family member, or support group member you can call or message when you're experiencing a craving. They can provide encouragement and distract you from the urge.

7. **Breathing Exercises:** Deep, controlled breathing exercises can help reduce the stress and anxiety associated with cravings.

8. **Positive Affirmations:** Have a list of positive statements about yourself and your goals that you can recite when experiencing a craving. This reinforces your self-esteem and your commitment to overcoming the issue.

These are all strategies you can try, but remember, everyone is different. What works best for you may take some time and experimentation to figure out. If your cravings are severe or causing distress, seeking professional help can be a very effective step.

What are the beliefs I need to build and how I build them. My urges regularly come from work-related anxiety

Building beliefs that can help you manage urges stemming from work-related anxiety involves recognizing the underlying causes and working to create a mindset that supports positive coping strategies. Here's how you might approach it:

### Beliefs to Build:

1. **Self-Efficacy:** Believe that you have the ability to control your urges and manage your anxiety in healthy ways.

2. **Stress Management:** Recognize that work-related stress is normal but that it can be managed through healthy means, like exercise, meditation, or hobbies, rather than turning to PMO.

3. **Personal Growth and Resilience:** Develop the belief that overcoming these challenges will make you stronger and lead to personal growth.

4. **Value of Health and Well-Being:** Embrace the belief that your mental and physical health are important and that prioritizing them will lead to a more fulfilled life.

### How to Build These Beliefs:

1. **Education and Understanding:** Learn about healthy coping mechanisms for stress and the benefits of abstaining from PMO. The more you understand, the more rational your beliefs become.

2. **Positive Reinforcement:** Celebrate small successes and reinforce the idea that you have the power to change. Journaling about your progress might be helpful here.

3. **Mindfulness and Meditation Practices:** Regular mindfulness or meditation can help you build a sense of control and self-awareness, allowing you to better manage anxiety and cravings.

4. **Therapy and Counseling:** Professionals can help you understand the root of your anxiety, and work with you to build these positive beliefs and strategies.

5. **Social Support:** Surround yourself with friends, family, or support groups that encourage and reinforce these beliefs.

6. **Create a Daily Routine:** Structuring your day around healthy habits and positive activities can reinforce your new beliefs and create a solid foundation for managing anxiety.

7. **Visualizations and Affirmations:** Regularly visualizing your success and using positive affirmations can help solidify these beliefs.

Remember, building new beliefs takes time and consistent effort. These strategies are a starting point, but don't hesitate to seek professional help if you need more personalized support. It can be a highly effective way to understand and manage your specific triggers and anxiety.
