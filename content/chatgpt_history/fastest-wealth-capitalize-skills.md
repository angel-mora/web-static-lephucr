## âœ… TODOs


## ðŸ“Œ Summary
You are a business coach. Use the capital types of Bordieu to consult me to combine my fullstack ruby on rails skills and CompTIA Security+ with other forms of capital to get rich the fastest and least effort way. I am in Mexico, speak english and spanish. I'm smart and have strong background in philosophy. I want your consultancy to help me find business ideas of potential exponential growth business opportunities. I currently have little money saved but know a few potential investors who are quite conservative.

You are a business coach. Use the capital types of Bordieu to consult me to combine my fullstack ruby on rails skills and CompTIA Security+ with other forms of capital to get rich the fastest and least effort way. I am in Mexico, speak english and spanish. I'm smart and have strong background in philosophy. I want your consultancy to help me find business ideas of potential exponential growth business opportunities.

It's great to see your eagerness and readiness to leverage your current skills and the forms of capital you possess. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu identified three types of capital: Economic (money and wealth), Social (relationships, networks), and Cultural (skills, education, knowledge). Let's explore how you can utilize these forms of capital for your entrepreneurial success.

**1. Economic Capital:**

You've mentioned that you have a little money saved and have made an initial investment in a market research application. This is a good start, but we also need to consider your potential investors. While they may be conservative, that doesn't mean they won't invest in a promising idea. It's essential to present them with a clear, detailed, and profitable business plan.

**2. Social Capital:**

Networking is an often underestimated, but highly powerful tool. You need to utilize your connections and relationships in the industry, both in Mexico and beyond. Given that you speak both English and Spanish, this will be an advantage when communicating and connecting with different stakeholders in various regions. You can participate in industry-related events, meetups, webinars, online forums, etc. to extend your network. Also, leverage your relationships with your potential investors. 

**3. Cultural Capital:**

You already possess a lot of cultural capital. Your skills as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer, CompTIA Security+ certification, and a strong background in philosophy are valuable assets. Combined with the bi-lingual skill, you could potentially offer high-demand services or build products for an international market.

**Business Opportunities:**

Based on your cultural capital, I have a few suggestions:

1. **Cybersecurity Consultancy**: With your CompTIA Security+ certification, you could start a cybersecurity consultancy. Small and medium-sized businesses often lack the expertise to properly secure their digital assets. Your bilingual ability can be a distinct advantage in serving both English and Spanish speaking clients. To mitigate the initial capital requirements, you could start it as a remote consultancy.

2. **SaaS development**: Use your full-stack Ruby on Rails skills to develop a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. With your cybersecurity knowledge, you could create a unique selling point by developing a highly secure SaaS product. This could attract businesses that handle sensitive data and are concerned about data security. You could develop a minimal viable product (MVP) first to show your potential investors.

3. **Educational Content Creation**: Leverage your technical skills and philosophy background to create educational content. This could be in the form of an online course, YouTube channel, or even a podcast. This could generate a passive income stream while also improving your reputation and credibility in the field.

4. **Obsidian-based Social Network**: Since you already invested in gathering market information about Obsidian, consider the development of a social network based on this platform. Obsidian is increasingly popular among note-takers and knowledge workers. A social network built around this platform could attract a dedicated user base. 

Remember, the fastest way to wealth usually involves a combination of these paths, not just one. The exact mix will depend on your risk tolerance, commitment, and specific circumstances. You should further research these opportunities, validate your ideas, and build a strong business plan that you can present to your potential investors. It's also essential to continuously expand your social capital and enrich your cultural capital throughout this journey.
