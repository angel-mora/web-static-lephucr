# Request for Work Break

## âœ… TODOs


## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Doing bad at my job and want to drop out. Before doing so, since I'm a contractor, I'd like to request a month as an emergency since I no longer feel capable of working in it but don't want to make that decision now so asking to start again january 15th would be good enough.

Doing bad at my job and want to drop out. Before doing so, since I'm a contractor, I'd like to request a month as an emergency since I no longer feel capable of working in it but don't want to make that decision now so asking to start again january 15th would be good enough.



If youâ€™re considering stepping back but want to leave room to reassess in January, here's a way to frame the request thoughtfully:

1. **Express the need for time to recharge**: You could explain that you've been feeling overwhelmed, which has impacted your ability to perform at your best. Emphasize the need for time to reset and that you're committed to returning with a renewed focus.

2. **Emphasize your contractor role and flexibility**: Remind them that as a contractor, thereâ€™s some inherent flexibility in your schedule. Let them know youâ€™re committed to the project but need to prioritize your well-being to deliver effectively.

3. **Request a defined break**: Asking to start again on January 15th sets a clear timeline and shows youâ€™re serious about managing your time and work commitments effectively. Frame it as a request to *pause* rather than *drop out*, which can be seen as a proactive, responsible decision rather than a sudden withdrawal.

4. **Highlight your intent to return ready to contribute**: Emphasize that this break will help you return focused and prepared to contribute meaningfully, which ultimately benefits both you and the company.

**Subject:** Request for Temporary Break to Return Refreshed in January

Hi [Manager's Name],

Iâ€™m reaching out to discuss my current workload and to make a request regarding my availability for the next few weeks. Iâ€™ve been feeling increasingly overwhelmed and struggling to meet my usual standards of performance, and I believe taking some dedicated time to reset could be beneficial for both myself and the team.

Given the situation, Iâ€™d like to request a pause in my work starting at the end of this sprint, with the aim of returning on January 15th. This would allow me the time to recharge and regain focus so I can contribute effectively in the new year.

As a contractor, I value the flexibility that our arrangement offers, and Iâ€™m committed to ensuring that when I return, Iâ€™ll be in the best possible position to support our projects and meet our goals. If thereâ€™s anything I can do to help prepare for this break, please let me know. I want to ensure that I leave things in good order for the team.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
