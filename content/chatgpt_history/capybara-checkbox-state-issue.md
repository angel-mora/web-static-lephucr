The issue you're encountering with Capybara's `save_and_open_page` showing checkboxes as unchecked, even though they've been checked in your test, could be due to a few different reasons. Let's explore some potential causes and solutions:

1. **Asynchronous JavaScript**: If your checkboxes are being updated through JavaScript, there might be a timing issue. The `save_and_open_page` might be executing before the JavaScript has had a chance to update the state of the checkboxes. Using `wait_for_ajax` is a good approach, but ensure it's effectively waiting for all the JavaScript to complete.

2. **Capybara's Timing**: Capybara runs asynchronously from the JavaScript on the page. The `save_and_open_page` might be capturing the state of the page before the JavaScript has finished executing. Ensure that `wait_for_ajax` accurately waits for all asynchronous operations to complete.

3. **Incorrect Selectors**: Double-check the selectors used in the `check` method. Ensure they correctly reference the checkboxes you intend to manipulate.

4. **Check the Test Environment**: Sometimes, the test environment can behave differently from the development or production environments. Verify that all necessary JavaScript is being loaded and executed in the test environment.

5. **Use of `trigger(:click)`**: Instead of using `.trigger(:click)`, you could use Capybara's native `click_button` or `click_on` methods, which are more representative of actual user interaction and might handle the asynchronous nature of JavaScript better.

6. **Debugging with `byebug`**: You're using `byebug` for debugging; make sure to inspect the state of the page and the DOM elements at various points to understand when and if the state of the checkboxes changes.

7. **Inspect the HTML Structure**: Ensure that the HTML structure (as rendered in the test environment) is correct and that the checkboxes are indeed present and not hidden or obscured by other elements.

8. **Review Ruby/Rails Code**: The way the checkboxes are being rendered in the ERB template looks correct, but ensure that thereâ€™s no conditional logic in the Ruby/Rails code that might be affecting the rendering of these elements under test conditions.

9. **Capybara Configuration**: Check your Capybara configuration to ensure it's optimal for your testing environment. Settings related to wait time, driver, and JavaScript execution might need tweaking.

If these suggestions don't resolve the issue, consider creating a minimal, reproducible example that isolates the problem. This approach can often help in pinpointing the exact cause of issues like this.
