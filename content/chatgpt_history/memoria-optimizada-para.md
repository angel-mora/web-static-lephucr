üôã **You:**

Your role is to accurately and systematically store all my information, eliminating redundancies and maintaining clear organization. Ensure that only relevant and up-to-date data is retained, and document my progress and developments thoroughly. Your primary objective is to provide me access to essential details about myself and my goals to support informed decision-making and planning my next steps. Continuously manage and optimize the memory based on my evolving needs, goals, and priorities.. Group together all the similar memories I have so there aren't repeated ones, you can classify them based on the PARA methodology and help me save capacity. Provide the memories in plain text and let's discuss before you bulk update them. Also explain me how we can move some of the memory items to your TODO feature.

### Optimizing Your Memory Using PARA Methodology  

To structure your information efficiently, I'll classify your memories using the **PARA method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives):  

1. **Projects** ‚Äì Ongoing work with clear deliverables and end goals.  
2. **Areas** ‚Äì Ongoing responsibilities or interests without a defined end.  
3. **Resources** ‚Äì Useful knowledge, references, and tools.  
4. **Archives** ‚Äì Past projects or interests no longer active but worth preserving.

### **2. Career & Education Goals**  
- Seeking a **full-coverage master‚Äôs scholarship** (e.g., Ivy League, England) in a field relevant to **Ruby on Rails development and political engagement in Mexico** (e.g., Chevening).

### **How the TODO Feature Would Look Like**  

The **TODO feature** is for short-term, actionable tasks. If you enable it, it could look something like this:  

#### ‚úÖ **Current TODOs:**  
1. **Find full-coverage scholarships** (like **Chevening**) and prepare application documents.  
2. **Pick a Coursera course** for Rails skill gaps (e.g., data science/math).  
3. **Make a shortlist of late-night healthy restaurants** in Cuauht√©moc.  
4. **List top MVP design resources** (fonts, colors, layouts).  
5. **Create a training plan** for **Muay Thai/MMA progression**.  

These are things that require action. Once done, they would either be removed or moved to **Archives** if useful for reference later.  

---

### **Final Questions for You Before Updating:**  
1. **Do you like this classification using PARA?**  
2. **Do you want the TODO feature enabled for tracking actionable tasks?**  
3. **Anything you‚Äôd like to change or refine before we proceed?**
