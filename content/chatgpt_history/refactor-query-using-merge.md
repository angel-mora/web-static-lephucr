# Refactor Query Using Merge

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

could you help me refactor the following query using the method merge?
ReviewStats::OfferingReviewCount.joins(:offering).where(offerings:{ published: status }).to_sql
=> "SELECT `offering_review_counts`.* FROM `offering_review_counts` INNER JOIN `offerings` ON `offerings`.`deleted_at` IS NULL AND `offerings`.`id` = `offering_review_counts`.`offering_id` WHERE `offerings`.`published` = TRUE"

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! To refactor your query using the `merge` method in Rails, you can extract the condition inside the `where` method related to `offerings` into a named scope within your `Offering` model. This makes the query more readable and modular. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define a named scope in the `Offering` model:
   ```ruby
   class Offering < ApplicationRecord
     scope :published, ->(status) { where(published: status) }
   end
   ```

2. Now refactor your original query using the `merge` method:
   ```ruby
   ReviewStats::OfferingReviewCount.joins(:offering).merge(Offering.published(status)).to_sql
   ```

In this refactored query, `merge` is used to combine the conditions defined in the `published` scope of the `Offering` model with the main query. This approach improves the modularity and readability of your code by abstracting the conditions related to the `Offering` model into its own scope.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

could you help me make this scope reusable as the one I am showing in the example 

scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
      return if user_id.blank?

      joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(user_categories_coverages: { user_id: user_id })
    }

example

scope :with_service_context, lambda { |can_see|
      can_see ? joins(:offering_id).merge(Offering.service_context) : joins(:offering_id).merge(Offering.not_service_context)
    }

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! To make your `by_user_preference` scope reusable similar to the `with_service_context` example, you need to create scopes in the associated model (presumably `UserCategoriesCoverage` in this case) that can be used within the `merge` method. Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Define Scopes in the Associated Model:**
   Assuming `UserCategoriesCoverage` is the associated model, define scopes in it that can be reused. For example:
   ```ruby
   class UserCategoriesCoverage < ApplicationRecord
     scope :for_user, ->(user_id) { where(user_id: user_id) }
   end
   ```

2. **Refactor the `by_user_preference` Scope:**
   Now, use this newly defined scope in your `by_user_preference` scope. The refactored scope in your model might look like this:
   ```ruby
   scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
     return if user_id.blank?

     joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages)
       .merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.for_user(user_id))
   }
   ```

In this refactored version, the `by_user_preference` scope joins with the `user_categories_coverages` through `categories` and then uses the `merge` method to apply the `for_user` scope from `UserCategoriesCoverage`. This makes the scope more modular and reusable, as the user filtering logic is encapsulated within the `for_user` scope of `UserCategoriesCoverage`.

This approach follows the principle of separating concerns by keeping the user-specific filtering logic within the `UserCategoriesCoverage` model, which can be reused in other parts of your application as well.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

i would like to refactor this one
scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
  return if user_id.blank?

  joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages)
    .merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.for_user(user_id))
}

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To refactor the `by_user_preference` scope for better reusability and readability, you can follow these steps:

1. **Abstract Conditions into Named Scopes:** If there are specific conditions or filters that are likely to be reused or that represent a specific business logic, you can abstract them into named scopes within the relevant models. This approach makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

2. **Handle `nil` or Blank User ID Gracefully:** Instead of returning `nil` immediately when the `user_id` is blank, you can design the scope to handle this situation more gracefully. For example, you might want to return all records when no user ID is provided, or you might want to ensure the scope always returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation` object for chaining purposes.

3. **Improve Readability:** Use a multi-line block for clarity, especially if the scope might be extended in the future.

Here's a refactored version of your scope:

```ruby
scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
  # You can modify this line to handle blank user_ids differently, if needed
  return all if user_id.blank?

  joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages)
    .merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.for_user(user_id))
}
```

In this refactored version:

- The scope now returns `all` if `user_id` is blank. This ensures that the scope always returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, allowing for further query chaining. You can modify this behavior based on your application's requirements.
- The structure is kept simple and readable. If you have other conditions or filters to add in the future, they can be easily integrated into this structure.

Remember, the key to refactoring is not just about altering the code but making it more maintainable, readable, and adaptable for future changes.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

could you follow this example?
scope :with_service_context, lambda { |can_see|
      can_see ? joins(:offering_id).merge(Offering.service_context) : joins(:offering_id).merge(Offering.not_service_context)
    }

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Certainly! To refactor your `by_user_preference` scope in a way that's similar to the `with_service_context` example, you can introduce conditional logic inside the lambda function. This allows you to dynamically choose between different merges based on the condition. However, in the case of `by_user_preference`, the condition seems to be whether or not a `user_id` is provided.

Hereâ€™s how you can refactor it:

1. **Define Two Scopes in the `UserCategoriesCoverage` Model:**
   - One for when a `user_id` is provided (already exists as `for_user`).
   - Another for when no `user_id` is provided (this could return all records or apply a default filter).

   For example, in `UserCategoriesCoverage` model:
   ```ruby
   scope :for_user, ->(user_id) { where(user_id: user_id) }
   scope :no_user, -> { all }  # or any default behavior you prefer
   ```

2. **Refactor the `by_user_preference` Scope:**
   Use a ternary operator to choose between these two scopes based on whether `user_id` is present or not.

   ```ruby
   scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
     user_id.present? ?
       joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.for_user(user_id)) :
       joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.no_user)
   }
   ```

In this refactored version, the `by_user_preference` scope uses a ternary operator to decide which scope to merge from `UserCategoriesCoverage` based on whether `user_id` is present. This approach makes the scope more flexible and follows a pattern similar to your `with_service_context` example. It allows for a clearer distinction between different behaviors depending on the presence of `user_id`.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

could you help me create the scopes for my model for_user and for no_user

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Absolutely! To create the scopes `for_user` and `for_no_user` in your model, typically `UserCategoriesCoverage` in this context, you would add these scopes to the model class. The `for_user` scope filters records based on a provided `user_id`, while the `for_no_user` scope handles the scenario where no user ID is provided. Here's how you can define them:

1. **Scope `for_user`:** This scope filters the records where the `user_id` matches the provided ID. It's useful for retrieving records specific to a given user.

    ```ruby
    class UserCategoriesCoverage < ApplicationRecord
      scope :for_user, ->(user_id) { where(user_id: user_id) }
    end
    ```

2. **Scope `for_no_user`:** The purpose of this scope can vary based on your application's logic. If you want to return all records when no user ID is provided, the scope can be defined to return all records. Alternatively, you can define a default filter that applies when no user ID is present.

    - If you want to return all records:
      ```ruby
      scope :for_no_user, -> { all }
      ```

    - If you want to apply a default filter (for example, filtering out some records based on a specific condition), you could define it like so:
      ```ruby
      scope :for_no_user, -> { where(some_condition: value) }
      ```

Remember to replace `some_condition: value` with the actual condition you want to apply in the `for_no_user` scope.

By defining these scopes in your `UserCategoriesCoverage` model, you can easily reuse them in various parts of your application, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

I have this error from this lamnda 
Avoid multi-line ternary operators, use `if` or `unless` instead. (convention:Style/MultilineTernaryOperator)

scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
       user_id.present? ?
      joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(Offering.by_user_id(user_id)) :
      joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(Offering.no_user)
    }

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The warning you're encountering is related to Ruby style conventions, which recommend avoiding multi-line ternary operators for better readability. Instead, you can use a regular `if/else` statement within the lambda. Here's how you can refactor your `by_user_preference` scope:

```ruby
scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
  if user_id.present?
    joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(Offering.by_user_id(user_id))
  else
    joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(Offering.no_user)
  end
}
```

In this refactored version, the scope uses a standard `if/else` structure to decide which merge to apply. This approach adheres to Ruby's style conventions and improves the readability of your code.

could you integrate this model 
class UserCategoriesCoverage < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_paranoid

  belongs_to :user, counter_cache: true
  belongs_to :category

  validates(:user_id, :category_id, presence: true)

  def self.create_user_categories_coverage(user_id, category_ids, current_user_id)
    UserCategoriesCoverage.transaction do
      category_ids.each do |id|
        category_coverage_create = UserCategoriesCoverage.where(user_id: user_id, category_id: id).unscope(where: :deleted_at)
        if category_coverage_create.present?
          category_coverage_create.each do |result|
            result.update!(deleted_by: nil, deleted_at: nil)
          end
          User.reset_counters(user_id, :user_categories_coverages)
        else
          UserCategoriesCoverage.create!(user_id: user_id, category_id: id, created_by: current_user_id, updated_by: current_user_id, created_at: Time.current, updated_at: Time.current)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
to build this query

 scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
      if user_id.present?
        joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.(user_id: 
user_id))
          else
        joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.no_user)
      end
    }

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

Integrating the `UserCategoriesCoverage` model with the `by_user_preference` scope involves defining relevant scopes in the `UserCategoriesCoverage` model that can be used with the `.merge` method in your scope. Based on your model definition, you'll want to define two scopes: one for when a `user_id` is present (`for_user`) and another for when no user is specified (`no_user`).

Here's how you can add these scopes to your `UserCategoriesCoverage` model:

```ruby
class UserCategoriesCoverage < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_paranoid

  belongs_to :user, counter_cache: true
  belongs_to :category

  validates(:user_id, :category_id, presence: true)

  # Define a scope for filtering by user_id
  scope :for_user, ->(user_id) { where(user_id: user_id) }

  # Define a scope for when no user is specified
  scope :no_user, -> { all }

  # ... existing methods ...

  def self.create_user_categories_coverage(user_id, category_ids, current_user_id)
    # ... existing implementation ...
  end
end
```

Now, with these scopes defined, you can refactor the `by_user_preference` scope in your other model. Assuming this scope is in a model that has a relationship with `UserCategoriesCoverage` through `categories`, the refactored scope will look like this:

```ruby
scope :by_user_preference, lambda { |user_id|
  if user_id.present?
    joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.for_user(user_id))
  else
    joins(categories: :user_categories_coverages).merge(UserCategoriesCoverage.no_user)
  end
}
```

This refactored scope now correctly uses the `for_user` and `no_user` scopes from the `UserCategoriesCoverage` model. When `user_id` is present, it joins and merges with the `for_user` scope, and when `user_id` is not present, it joins and merges with the `no_user` scope. This approach maintains a clean separation of concerns and enhances the readability and maintainability of your code.
