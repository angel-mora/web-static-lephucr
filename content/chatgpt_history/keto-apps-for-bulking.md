Best keto app for hypertrophy and bulking



For those focusing on keto while aiming for hypertrophy and bulking, the best apps should offer precise macro tracking, meal planning, and workout logs. Here are a few apps that fit these needs:

1. **Carb Manager**: This app is highly popular for keto diet tracking. It allows you to set specific goals for protein intake, which is crucial for muscle growth. It includes a large food database and can help you track your daily protein, fat, and carb intake precisely.

2. **MyFitnessPal**: Although not strictly a keto app, MyFitnessPal is versatile for tracking macros, including high protein and low-carb intake for bulking. You can customize your macro goals and track progress against them, making it suitable for those combining keto with strength training.

3. **KetoDiet**: This app is specifically designed for keto enthusiasts and offers meal plans tailored to specific goals, such as muscle gain. It also has a community feature where you can find support and tips from other users on a similar fitness journey.

4. **Fitbod**: While not specifically keto-focused, Fitbod is great for customizing workout plans based on your hypertrophy goals. It adapts workouts based on your progress and equipment availability, making it useful when paired with a separate keto tracking app for diet management.

Combining one of these diet apps (like Carb Manager or MyFitnessPal) with a workout-focused app (like Fitbod) can provide a balanced approach to tracking both your keto diet and hypertrophy progress.
