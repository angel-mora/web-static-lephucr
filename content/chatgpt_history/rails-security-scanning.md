How can I use breakman to perform security scanning in pull requests?
What other resources can I do analyze safety in pull requests?

Sure, I can provide information on using Brakeman to perform security scanning in pull requests and also introduce some other tools and resources that can be utilized to analyze safety in pull requests.

### Using Brakeman for Security Scanning

[Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org/) is a vulnerability scanner specifically designed for Ruby on Rails applications. It can be used to analyze your codebase and detect security vulnerabilities. Here's how you can integrate Brakeman into your pull request workflow:

1. **Install Brakeman:** You can add Brakeman to your Gemfile with `gem 'brakeman', require: false`, or install it directly via the command line using `gem install brakeman`.

2. **Run Brakeman Locally:** Run Brakeman with the `brakeman` command in your Rails root directory. This will generate a report that you can review manually.

3. **Integrate with Continuous Integration (CI):** You can set up Brakeman to run automatically on every pull request by integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline. If you are using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or another CI service, you can write a script that installs and runs Brakeman on every pull request. The process might vary depending on your specific CI system.

   Example GitHub Action:

   ```yaml
   name: Brakeman
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Ruby
         uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
       - name: Install Brakeman
         run: gem install brakeman
       - name: Run Brakeman
         run: brakeman
   ```

   If any vulnerabilities are found, the CI build will fail, and you can inspect the issues in the CI logs.

### Other Resources for Analyzing Safety in Pull Requests

1. **RuboCop:** RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer that can be used to enforce coding standards and best practices, including some security-related checks.

2. **CodeClimate:** CodeClimate provides automated code review for test coverage, maintainability, and more, and has a specific engine for Brakeman integration.

3. **GitHub's Dependabot:** Dependabot can monitor your dependencies and create pull requests to update insecure dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

4. **Snyk:** Snyk is a tool that can help you find and fix known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, and it can be integrated with your CI/CD pipeline as well.

5. **GitLab's Security Scanners:** If you're using GitLab, you have access to built-in security scanning tools that include SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and more.

By integrating these tools into your development and review processes, you can make sure that your Ruby on Rails application follows best practices for security and that vulnerabilities are caught early in the development cycle.

I want to do it manually for now

Sure! Running Brakeman manually is simple and gives you control over when and how you scan your Ruby on Rails application. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Brakeman**: If you haven't already, install Brakeman using the following command:

   ```bash
   gem install brakeman
   ```

2. **Run Brakeman in Your Project's Root Directory**: Navigate to your Ruby on Rails project's root directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   brakeman
   ```

   This will scan your Rails application and output any warnings in the terminal. 

3. **Generate a Report**: If you prefer to review the results in a different format, you can generate a report in HTML, JSON, or other formats. For example, to create an HTML report, you can use:

   ```bash
   brakeman -o report.html
   ```

   This will create an HTML file named `report.html` in your current directory, containing the results of the scan.

4. **Review the Results**: Inspect the warnings and take note of any areas that need attention. This manual process allows you to evaluate each warning and decide on the best course of action for your particular codebase.

5. **Integrate into Pull Requests**: If you want to manually review pull requests, you can check out the branch locally and run Brakeman on it, following the steps above. You can then comment on the pull request with your findings or ask the contributor to make necessary changes.

6. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of the issues you've identified and the changes you've made to make sure you're addressing any vulnerabilities.

Running Brakeman manually gives you flexibility and control, but it does require consistent discipline to ensure that scans are run regularly and that identified issues are addressed promptly. If you plan to scale your project or collaborate with a team, consider setting up an automated system down the road to maintain a strong security posture.

I want to use breakman but only for current branch changes

Running Brakeman only on the changes made in the current branch isn't something Brakeman natively supports, as it's designed to analyze the whole Rails application. However, you can somewhat work around this limitation by following these steps:

1. **Check Out the Branch**: Ensure you have checked out the branch you want to analyze.

2. **Run Brakeman on the Entire Project**: Since Brakeman scans the entire project, you'll first need to run it normally:

   ```bash
   brakeman
   ```

3. **Identify the Changes in the Current Branch**: You can use Git to identify the files that have changed in the current branch compared to the main branch (or whichever branch you want to compare against):

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only main...HEAD
   ```

   Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if necessary.

4. **Manually Review the Brakeman Report for the Changed Files**: You'll need to manually look through the Brakeman warnings and match them with the files identified in the Git diff. Focus on the warnings related to the files that have been changed in the current branch.

5. **Address the Relevant Warnings**: Once you have identified the warnings related to the current branch changes, analyze them and make the necessary code adjustments.

6. **Consider Automation for the Future**: While this manual process can work for a small project or a one-time analysis, it can become cumbersome in a larger project or with frequent analyses. If you find yourself needing to do this regularly, you might want to consider scripting this process or using additional tooling to automate parts of it.

Unfortunately, the manual process does have some limitations, especially if changes in the branch affect the application's overall security posture in ways that aren't directly tied to the changed files. It's typically beneficial to consider the entire context of the application, which is why Brakeman is designed to analyze the full codebase. But focusing on changes within a branch may still provide useful insights into potential vulnerabilities introduced by those changes.
