Give me a writer’s manual for NY style fashion writing with emojis and using all the slang. It should teach me indirect lessons like sarcasm and irony

🤖 **Assistant:**

**Title: NY Style Fashion Writing: The Definitive Slang-and-Emoji Guide**

1. **Introduction to NY Style Fashion Writing**

New York fashion writing is as vibrant and varied as the city itself. It's filled with its own jargon, humor, and specific emojis to match. To thrive in this world, you'll need to master the lingo, tone, and symbolism.

2. **Mastering Slang and Jargon**

NY style fashion is constantly evolving, and so is the language. Some popular terms include:

   - **"On Fleek"**: Meaning something is perfect or on point.
   - **"Slay"**: To absolutely dominate, often used to describe an outstanding outfit.
   - **"OOTD"**: Outfit of the Day.
   - **"Fashion Forward"**: Being ahead of current trends.

Stay plugged into the scene to keep up-to-date with new phrases.

3. **Emojis - The Unspoken Language**

Emojis can make your writing more lively and relatable. They should complement your tone, not overpower it. Some favorites in fashion writing are:

   - 👗: Used when talking about dresses or general outfit.
   - 👠: Indicates high heels, glamour, or style.
   - 💅: Used to express diva behavior, self-care, or pampering.
   - 🕶️: When talking about accessories, especially sunglasses.
   - 💖: Used to show love or affection for a particular style or trend.

Remember, less is often more when it comes to emoji use. 

4. **Sarcasm and Irony: The Subtle Art**

Sarcasm and irony are often used in NY style fashion writing to provide a punch or illustrate a point. For example, if a fashion week outfit is overly extravagant, you might write, "Sure, because everyone needs a sequined jumpsuit for a casual Sunday brunch 💅."

Remember, sarcasm and irony are all about the context and the contrast between what's said (or written) and the reality.

5. **Playful Insults**

Another characteristic of NY style fashion writing is playfully insulting phrases or words, usually used to express disbelief at a fashion faux pas. Phrases like "What was she thinking?!" or "Someone call the fashion police! 🚨" can be fun if used sparingly and appropriately.

6. **Writing Style: Short and Snappy**

Keep your sentences short, snappy, and packed with personality. This is the language of social media, after all. 

7. **Keep it Real**

Finally, always keep it authentic. Readers can tell if you're trying too hard. Dive into the world you're writing about, learn the lingo, embrace the culture, and the rest will follow. 

Remember, fashion writing is supposed to be fun, dynamic, and even a bit cheeky. Enjoy it! 🍾

🤖 **Assistant:**

Sure, let's put together some guidelines for your NY style fashion writing with emojis, slang, and a touch of sarcasm and irony. 

1. **Know your fashion lingo**: Stay up-to-date with the latest fashion terms, trends, and slang. These can range from "on fleek" (meaning perfectly executed) to "extra" (over the top). It's important to know what's in vogue so you can communicate effectively with your readers.

2. **Master the use of emojis**: Use emojis to convey emotion and add a playful touch to your writing. For instance, 👗 can be used when talking about dresses, 👠 for shoes, etc. However, don't overdo it. Remember, emojis are like a sprinkle of icing on a cake, not the main ingredient. 

3. **Stay chic, stay sarcastic**: Sarcasm is an art, and when done right, it can add an edgy, humorous spin to your writing. Example: "Oh, and that look? It's just what every girl dreams of wearing while walking her dog at 7am." 

4. **Inject irony for an edgy twist**: Use irony to make your readers think and often, laugh. For instance, "The model strutted down the catwalk in a fur coat that was perfect for a summer's day in the Sahara." 

5. **Write with an attitude**: NY style fashion writing is all about confidence and attitude. It's cheeky, it's stylish, and it's unapologetic. The key is to strike a balance between being critical and appreciative. 

6. **Refer to the NYC Scene**: Use the New York scene to color your descriptions. Namedrop neighborhoods, bars, famous streets and landmarks. This gives authenticity to your writing.

7. **Get inspiration from NY fashion icons**: Reference style inspiration from New York fashion icons. This not only gives credibility to your writing, but also offers your readers a sense of belonging and identification.

8. **Analyze and critique**: Remember to add value to your content by offering your analysis and critique of fashion trends and events. 

Remember, your unique voice and style will be what sets you apart, so don't be afraid to experiment and develop your own fashion writing signature. Good luck!

Well, darling, pull up your trendiest chair, grab a macchiato, and let's dive into the fabulously chaotic world of NY style fashion writing. 

1. **Speak the Lingo, Honey**: Keep your ear to the runway, catch the latest whispers of fashion slang. From "on fleek" to "extra," your vocabulary should scream chic. And remember, a look is never just a look, it’s a "lewkkk" 🕶️. 

2. **Emoji Game on Point**: Use emojis, like the fashionable hieroglyphs they are. Each 👗 and each 👠 is a statement, but darling, don't douse your prose in them. They're a side salad, not the entrée.

3. **Sarcasm is your Chanel No. 5**: Spritz it liberally but elegantly. "Oh, that ensemble? Absolutely perfect for grocery shopping at midnight," and voila! You've got them smirking. 

4. **Irony, the Favorite Accessory**: Flaunt it like a Gucci clutch at a dive bar. "A fur coat in the Sahara sun. Refreshing!" Remember, the unexpected is always en vogue.

5. **Strut with Attitude**: NY style isn't just about clothes; it's an attitude, a lifestyle. Write like you’re walking down 5th Avenue, wind in your hair, all eyes on you. It’s saucy, it’s fierce, and it won’t apologize for being the best-dressed in the room.

6. **New York, Darling**: Your writing should reek of the Big Apple. Throw in mentions of Williamsburg loft parties or quiet café corners in Greenwich. Your readers should smell the pretzel stands and hear the city’s buzz as they pore over your words.

7. **Channel Your Inner Fashionista**: Take cues from the NY fashion elite. Whether it's referencing Anna Wintour's signature bob or Alexander Wang’s minimalistic chic, make your reader feel like they're brushing shoulders with the fashion royals.

8. **Play the Critic, but Make It Fashion**: Your readers crave your opinion. Dismantle a look, weave it back together, make them see the genius, or the disaster. Your words are your runway.

Fashion writing isn't just about describing what's hot and what's not; it's an art form of its own. Be bold, be chic, be daring. Own your unique style and let it shine through your writing. Strut your stuff, darling! 💅🏼💄👠
