# Firewall Zone Service Retrieval

## ðŸ§  Full Chat

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

firewall cdm get services specific zone

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

To retrieve specific services associated with a particular zone in a firewall, you would typically use the command line interface (CLI) or a web-based management console, depending on the type and manufacturer of the firewall. Unfortunately, there is no universally applicable command for all firewall systems. 

However, as an example, here's a general process for how you might do this on a Cisco device using the CLI:

1. Connect to the firewall through the console cable or SSH.
2. Enter your username and password to log in.
3.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

firewall-cdm --get-services specific zone

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

It seems like you're trying to get information about specific services associated with a specific zone in a firewall, possibly using `firewalld` in Linux. However, the command you've written appears to be a mixture of `firewalld-cmd` and other Linux commands and might not be correct.

If you are indeed using `firewalld` on a Linux system, you might be looking for a command like this:

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=yourzonename --list-services
```

Replace `yourzonename` with the name of the zone for which you want to list services. This command will show you the services that are allowed through the firewall for the specific zone.

Make sure to run this command with appropriate permissions (you might need `sudo` depending on your setup). 

Also, remember that the state of the firewall shown by `firewall-cmd` may not reflect the permanent configuration of the firewall. To check the permanent configuration, add the `--permanent` option like this:

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=yourzonename --list-services
```

This command shows you the services that will be allowed when the firewall is reloaded or the system is rebooted.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

firewall-cmd block specific ip

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If you want to block a specific IP address using `firewall-cmd`, you can do it by adding a rich rule. Here is an example of how to block the IP address 192.0.2.1:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='192.0.2.1' reject"
```

You replace '192.0.2.1' with the IP address you wish to block. 

This command will add a rich rule to the default zone of your firewall configuration. The rule says to reject all traffic from the IP address 192.0.2.1. 

Please note that the `--permanent` option makes the rule persistent across reboots. 

After adding the rule, you need to reload the firewall for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Remember to have appropriate permissions (like `sudo`) when executing these commands, depending on your setup.

Keep in mind that blocking IP addresses can potentially deny legitimate traffic, so make sure that the IP address you're blocking is not needed for any legitimate purposes.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

how is that different from using add icmp block inversion

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The `--add-icmp-block-inversion` command in `firewall-cmd` operates on a different level compared to blocking a specific IP address. 

The `--add-icmp-block-inversion` option blocks all incoming ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages and allows only ICMP responses. ICMP is used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

So, if you use:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-icmp-block-inversion
```

And then reload the firewall:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Your firewall will block all incoming ICMP messages except for the responses to messages originated from your system.

Blocking a specific IP address with a rich rule, on the other hand, prevents all traffic from the specified IP address, not just ICMP messages.

In other words, using `--add-icmp-block-inversion` affects the handling of a specific type of network traffic (ICMP), while blocking an IP address affects all traffic from that address. These are different tools for different purposes.
