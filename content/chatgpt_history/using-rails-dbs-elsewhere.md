Rails - Databases
I am aware that rails enforcements do not apply in db, which means that database is dependant on rails. Is it possible to use the dbs for complex applications without rails if would like to migrate to a different framework?

Yes, it's absolutely possible to use databases created or managed by Rails with other frameworks or even standalone applications. When you use Rails with a database, the database itself is just a standard database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.). Rails provides a convenient way to interact with the database through ActiveRecord and migrations, but underneath, it's all just standard SQL.

Here's what you'd need to keep in mind if you want to migrate or utilize your Rails-managed database elsewhere:

1. **Database Schema**: The schema created by Rails is a reflection of your ActiveRecord models and migrations. You can inspect the schema directly in the `db/schema.rb` file or by accessing your database using a tool like `pgAdmin` (for PostgreSQL) or any other relevant database management tool.

2. **Conventions**: Rails follows specific conventions, like table names being the pluralized version of the model name. If you're moving to a different framework, you might need to be aware of these conventions unless the new framework also follows similar principles.

3. **Migrations**: Rails provides a migration system to keep track of changes to the database schema. If you're moving away from Rails, you might need to implement a different system for database versioning or simply manage the schema changes manually.

4. **Complex Features**: If you've implemented more complex database features that are Rails-specific (like serialized columns or storing data in specific formats), you'd need to handle that in your new application or framework.

5. **Relationships and Joins**: Associations in ActiveRecord like `has_many` or `belongs_to` translate to foreign key relationships and JOIN operations in SQL. Another framework or library will handle these differently, so you'd need to adapt your queries and logic accordingly.

6. **Query Interface**: Rails' ActiveRecord provides a high-level query interface for database operations. If you move to a different framework or language, you might be working at a lower level with SQL or use another ORM/ODM.

7. **Dependencies**: If you have used specific database extensions or plugins that tie closely with Rails, you might need to find alternatives or handle that functionality differently in your new environment.

In summary, while the database managed by Rails is "just a database," the way Rails interacts with it is through a series of conventions and tools. If you're migrating away from Rails or want to use the database elsewhere, you'll need to be mindful of these conventions and possibly write a fair amount of adaptation code.

However, many people have successfully transitioned from Rails to other frameworks or used Rails databases in polyglot environments, so it's definitely doable with the right planning and understanding.

but I mean the insert, uniqueness or foreign key constrains only apply through active record

Ah, I see what you're getting at now.

Rails, by default, emphasizes a philosophy where the application layer (via ActiveRecord) enforces a lot of constraints like validation, uniqueness, etc., rather than relying heavily on the database to do so. This can sometimes lead to databases that don't have as many constraints defined at the database level as one might expect if coming from a traditional RDBMS-first approach.

If you've relied primarily on ActiveRecord validations and not set constraints at the database level, there are some potential issues if you move to a different framework or system:

1. **Data Integrity**: Without database-level constraints, there's a greater risk of data integrity issues. For example, you could accidentally insert duplicate records if you're relying on Rails' uniqueness validations but don't have a unique index at the database level.

2. **Performance**: Database-level constraints can sometimes offer performance benefits, like unique indexes speeding up certain queries.

3. **Unexpected Behavior**: Other frameworks or raw SQL might allow operations that Rails would have prevented, leading to unexpected behaviors or data integrity issues.

4. **Concurrency Issues**: Relying solely on application-level uniqueness checks can introduce race conditions in concurrent environments. Two threads might check for uniqueness simultaneously, find no conflicts, and then both proceed to insert, resulting in a violation of the uniqueness expectation.

If you're considering migrating to a different framework or want to ensure your database is robust outside of Rails:

1. **Add Database Constraints**: Before migrating, consider adding database-level constraints for things you've previously only enforced via ActiveRecord. This includes:
   - Unique constraints
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Check constraints

2. **Review Validations**: Go through your Rails models and identify any validations that don't have corresponding constraints in the database. Consider how to translate these into database constraints or how to enforce them in your new environment.

3. **Migration Tool**: If you're switching to a different ORM or framework, they might have their own migration tools to help transition and manage the database.

4. **Testing**: Rigorous testing will be crucial. Ensure that the new environment respects all the constraints and rules you expect. Consider writing integration tests that specifically target data integrity and constraint scenarios.

While Rails' philosophy emphasizes flexibility and developer convenience, sometimes at the expense of leveraging the full power of the RDBMS, it's always a good practice to ensure that important constraints are enforced at the database level for the sake of robustness and data integrity.

Is there any way to enforce active record constrains to the db before migrating to a new framework or exposing the db to another service? Like a gem?

Yes, there are ways to push Rails/ActiveRecord constraints down to the database layer, and it's a good idea to do so for reasons of data integrity, especially when exposing the DB to other services or migrating.

1. **Strong Migrations**: The gem [`strong_migrations`](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) ensures that your migrations are safe and won't lead to issues in a production environment. While its primary focus is to avoid dangerous operations and downtime during migrations, it also encourages good practices, such as adding indexes concurrently.

2. **Foreigner**: In older versions of Rails (before 4.2), foreign key support was not built-in, and the [`foreigner`](https://github.com/matthuhiggins/foreigner) gem was a popular choice to add foreign keys. However, starting from Rails 4.2 and onwards, native support for foreign keys was added, and you can easily add them in migrations with the `add_foreign_key` method.

3. **Database Validations**: You should manually ensure that critical validations in your models have corresponding constraints in the database:
   - For uniqueness validations in Rails, add a unique index in the database. You can do this in a migration with the `add_index` method and the `unique: true` option.
   - For presence validations on relational data, use foreign keys.
   - For custom validations, consider whether a custom database constraint (like a `CHECK` constraint in PostgreSQL) might be appropriate.

4. **Tools Outside of Rails**: If you're using PostgreSQL, tools like [`pgAdmin`](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or [`DBeaver`](https://dbeaver.io/) allow you to inspect and add constraints through a graphical interface. For MySQL, there's the popular [`MySQL Workbench`](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

5. **Schema Auto-enforcer**: While not a gem, you can also create a custom rake task or script that reads your ActiveRecord models, inspects their validations, and then checks the database to ensure corresponding constraints exist. This would require a deeper knowledge of both ActiveRecord's internals and your database system but could be valuable if you have a large application and want to automate the process.

6. **SchemaPlus Family**: The [`SchemaPlus`](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_plus) family of gems (like `schema_plus_core`, `schema_plus_indexes`, etc.) extends ActiveRecord's capabilities, making it easier to work with foreign keys, views, and other database features.

While the gems and tools mentioned above can help, the key thing is a manual review. It's essential to look at each model's validations and ask whether there's a corresponding database constraint that enforces that validation at the DB level, and add one if not.

Remember, while ActiveRecord validations provide user-friendly error messages and ensure data quality at the application layer, database constraints are your ultimate safety net against data integrity issues, especially when multiple services or systems interact with the same database.
