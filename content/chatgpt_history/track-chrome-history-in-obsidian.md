Ruby on Rails gem to handle books

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

If you're looking to handle books (e.g., cataloging, searching, sorting) within a Ruby on Rails application, there isn't a one-size-fits-all gem because the needs for handling books can vary based on the application's specific requirements.

However, here are some general steps and gems you might consider:

1. **Modeling the Book**:
   - You might have a `Book` model with attributes like `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `description`, `cover_image`, etc.

2. **Database and Searching**:
   - **`pg_search`**: If you're using PostgreSQL as your database, `pg_search` makes it easy to build a feature-rich search against your models.
   - **`ransack`**: This gem provides a way to search and filter data.

3. **Handling Book Covers/Images**:
   - **`carrierwave`**: For file uploads.
   - **`mini_magick`**: For image processing.
   - **`cloudinary`** or **`shrine`**: If you prefer cloud storage and advanced image handling.

4. **ISBN lookup and integration**:
   - **`googlebooks`**: This gem interacts with the Google Books API. You can look up a book by its ISBN and get details like title, authors, cover image, etc.

5. **Pagination**:
   - **`kaminari`** or **`will_paginate`**: Useful for pagination when you have a large number of books.

6. **Rating or Reviewing**:
   - **`acts_as_votable`**: If you want users to be able to rate books.
   - You can also create a `Review` model associated with a `Book` and `User` if you want detailed reviews.

7. **Categorizing Books**:
   - You can have a `Category` or `Genre` model and associate it with books. For tagging, **`acts-as-taggable-on`** is a popular gem.

8. **Import/Export Data**:
   - **`roo`**: If you need to import book data from Excel or CSV files.
   - **`axlsx_rails`**: If you need to export data to Excel.

Start by defining the exact features you want for handling books in your application. Then, pick the appropriate gems based on your needs. Remember to always check the gem's documentation, and consider the gem's maintenance status and community support before adding it to your project.

Cockpit vs OMV

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

"Cockpit" and "OpenMediaVault" (OMV) are both management interfaces, but they serve different primary purposes. Here's a brief comparison to help you understand their primary functionalities and use cases:

1. **Primary Purpose**:
   - **Cockpit**: It's a web-based interface primarily used for administering Linux servers. It provides a dashboard to manage multiple aspects of the server like services, networking, storage, performance metrics, and more.
   - **OpenMediaVault (OMV)**: OMV is primarily designed for home or small office Network Attached Storage (NAS) solutions. It helps users set up and manage their own NAS with features like file sharing, volume management, plugins for media services, etc.

2. **User Interface**:
   - **Cockpit**: Provides a clean, modern interface. It is intuitive and offers real-time system performance metrics.
   - **OMV**: It has a web-based interface tailored for NAS functionalities like disk management, RAID setup, and sharing options.

3. **Features**:
   - **Cockpit**: Can manage multiple Linux servers, handles system updates, terminal access within the interface, networking, and systemd services.
   - **OMV**: Focused on NAS features like SMB/CIFS, FTP, SSH, RSync, and more. It also supports a plethora of plugins to extend its capabilities.

4. **Installation**:
   - **Cockpit**: Can be installed on many Linux distributions using their package manager.
   - **OMV**: While it can be installed on top of Debian, many users opt to use the dedicated OMV ISO for a clean setup.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - **Cockpit**: Supports plugins and extensions for added functionalities.
   - **OMV**: Has a rich ecosystem of plugins for media services, cloud synchronization, backup solutions, etc.

6. **Target Audience**:
   - **Cockpit**: Ideal for system administrators who manage Linux servers.
   - **OMV**: Perfect for users (even with limited technical knowledge) wanting to set up their own NAS solution.

**Conclusion**: 
Your choice between Cockpit and OMV should depend on your primary need. If you're looking to set up and manage a NAS system, OMV is the way to go. If you're looking for a general Linux server management interface, Cockpit is more suitable.

ðŸ™‹ **You:**

I want to be able to keep track of my bookmarks and convert the json with my local chrome history into obsidian-compatible markdown notes in order to count things like amounts of visit to a website in such a way that when I visit that markdown entry, it modifies the file appending the last interaction timestamp, as well as a comment. Itâ€™s like if I had a plugin to annotate my history. The plugin would check if the website exists within the notes and open that file. How could I better achieve this task? With browser plugin? Obsidian plugin? The point of it is that I use my desktop to synchronize my browsing history across many devices. Eg. File Can have the domain name (linkedin.com) and in the description, having a (### Subheader) with the route (e.g. Angel-mora) and inside it the timestamp of a given note.

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The task you're looking to accomplish is complex, and there are multiple ways to approach it. Here's a general roadmap of how you could achieve it:

1. **Extracting History from Chrome**:
   - Chrome saves its history in a SQLite database (`'History'` file located in the Chrome's user data folder). You'd need to extract data from this database or use extensions that allow you to export your history in JSON format.
   
2. **Converting History to Obsidian-compatible Markdown**:
   - Write a script (e.g., in Python) that:
     1. Parses the exported JSON.
     2. Formats the data into the desired markdown format.
     3. Saves the markdown files in your Obsidian vault directory.

3. **Checking & Appending Data to Existing Notes**:
   - Modify the script to check if a markdown file for the given domain already exists.
   - If it does, append the new timestamp and comment to the appropriate section.
   - If it doesn't, create a new markdown file.

4. **Automating the Process**:
   - Ideally, you want this process to be as automated as possible. Here are two primary methods:

     1. **Browser Plugin**: 
        - This would be a more seamless integration. 
        - The plugin would monitor your browsing, and when you visit a site, it would directly interact with the local Obsidian vault and update the appropriate note.
        
     2. **Obsidian Plugin**:
        - The advantage here is that you're working within the Obsidian ecosystem.
        - The plugin would periodically check for updates in your Chrome history (or you could manually trigger it) and then update/create the notes as required.
        - This method might be less real-time compared to a browser plugin but might be easier to create as you're working within a single ecosystem.

5. **Synchronizing Across Devices**:
   - As you use your desktop to synchronize browsing history across devices, ensure that the Obsidian vault directory where you save these markdown notes is also synchronized across these devices (e.g., using Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). 

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - **Privacy**: Ensure that you're comfortable with processing your browsing history this way, especially if sensitive URLs are involved.
   - **Efficiency**: If you're visiting and updating several websites quickly, you'll want your solution to handle these updates efficiently.
   - **Data Backup**: Regularly back up your Obsidian notes and Chrome history to prevent any data loss.

Given the complexity of the task, you might want to start small â€“ perhaps manually exporting and converting a subset of your history â€“ and then iteratively improve and automate the process based on your needs.

Are there existing tools I can use? Could be obsidian plugin, chrome plugin or ruby gem

---

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a direct tool or plugin that offers the full functionality you've described out-of-the-box. However, you can combine a few tools and plugins to piece together a solution. Here are some tools and plugins that might assist you:

1. **Chrome Extensions for Exporting History**:
   - **[Export Chrome History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-chrome-history/dihloblpkeiddiaojbagoecedbfpifdj)**: This Chrome extension allows you to export your browser history to a CSV or JSON file.

2. **Obsidian Plugins**:
   - **[Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)**: This can be used to automatically back up your Obsidian vault (containing the markdown files) to a Git repository. You can automate the creation of new markdown files for the browsing data and use this plugin to version-control and backup the changes.
   - **[Obsidian Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri)**: Allows you to interact with Obsidian using URLs. It might be helpful if you decide to create a custom browser extension or script to automate interactions with Obsidian.
  
3. **Ruby Gems**:
   - **[Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/)**: If you need to parse the HTML content of web pages.
   - **[SQLite3](https://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3/)**: If you decide to extract history directly from Chrome's SQLite database.
   - **[CSV](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.0.0/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html)** or **[JSON](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.2/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html)** (part of the Ruby standard library): To handle the exported history data.

4. **Potential Workflow**:
   - Use a Chrome extension to periodically export your history as JSON.
   - Have a Ruby script (or another preferred language) to process this JSON:
     - Convert URLs to domain-specific markdown filenames.
     - Check if a markdown file for the domain already exists.
     - Append or create entries as required.
   - Utilize Obsidian plugins to integrate, link, or backup these entries.

5. **Automating the Entire Process**:
   - Depending on your OS, use task schedulers (like **cron** for Linux, **Task Scheduler** for Windows) to run the Ruby script at specific intervals.

While the above suggestions can help you in parts of your workflow, it seems you're looking for a unique combination of functionalities that might require some custom scripting or plugin development to fully realize. It might be a worthy project if you're familiar with development or a great way to learn and dive deeper into it!
