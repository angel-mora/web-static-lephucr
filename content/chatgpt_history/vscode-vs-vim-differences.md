Tell me common things that you can easily do in vscode but in vim

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Vim are both powerful editors, but they have different strengths and design philosophies. Some common tasks that are typically easier or more straightforward in VSCode compared to Vim include:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** VSCode has a modern, intuitive GUI, making tasks like file navigation, code folding, and project management more visually accessible and straightforward.

2. **Extensions and Integration:** VSCode offers a vast marketplace of extensions for languages, debuggers, and tools, allowing easy customization and enhancement of the editorâ€™s capabilities without requiring deep technical knowledge.

3. **Intellisense and Code Completion:** VSCode's advanced Intellisense provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules, often more sophisticated than what is typically available in Vim.

4. **Debugging Tools:** VSCode has built-in debugging support with an intuitive interface, including features like breakpoints, watch variables, call stacks, and an interactive console.

5. **Source Control Integration:** VSCode has seamless integration with Git and other version control systems, offering a visual interface for committing changes, reviewing diffs, and managing branches.

6. **Refactoring and Code Navigation:**
