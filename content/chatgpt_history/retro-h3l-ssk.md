Provide guiding questions for Highlights, Learned, Lacked and Longed For. I'll be leading this retro. Also guideline questions for Start, Stop and Keep doing



For a retrospective meeting, having clear and insightful guiding questions can really help facilitate meaningful discussion and actionable outcomes. Here are some suggested questions for each segment you mentioned:

### Highlights, Learned, Lacked, and Longed For (H3L)

1. **Highlights**
   - What successes or positive outcomes did we achieve in this period?
   - Can anyone share a moment that made them feel proud or satisfied?

2. **Learned**
   - What new knowledge or skills did we acquire?
   - Were there any insights gained through our recent work or challenges?

3. **Lacked**
   - What resources or support did we find ourselves missing?
   - Were there areas where you felt we could have done better with additional help?

4. **Longed For**
   - What were we hoping to achieve that we didn't?
   - Looking forward, what do we wish to have or achieve in the next period?

### Start, Stop, Keep Doing (SSK)

1. **Start**
   - What new practices or processes should we consider implementing?
   - Are there any new tools or approaches we think could benefit our projects?

2. **Stop**
   - What activities or processes are proving to be unproductive or hindering our progress?
   - Is there something that consistently frustrates the team that we can eliminate?

3. **Keep**
   - What are the practices or elements of our work that are currently effective?
   - Are there processes or behaviors that have positively impacted our productivity or morale that we should continue?

These questions can be tailored based on the specific context of your work and the dynamics of your team. They are designed to stimulate conversation, unearth insights, and guide your team towards continuous improvement.
