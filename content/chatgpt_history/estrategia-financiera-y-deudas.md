ü§ñ **Assistant:**

Based on the information provided, here's an overview, followed by some feedback on your financial situation:

### Overview
1. **Deudas de este mes**:
   - Total: 95.3K
   - Breakdown: 
     - 84.7K from UniK
     - 5K from Invex
     - 6.3K from Nu √Ångel
     - 16.5K from Nu Angela
     - 33.8K from BBVA √Ångela

2. **Deuda acumulada**: 146146.6 (without reductions)

3. **Ingressos & Pagos**:
   - **Nov 1-15 2023**: 33.1K EXCEDENTE after a total of -36.4K payments.
   - **Nov 15-30 2023**: 5700 EXCEDENTE after a total of -58.8K payments.

4. **Expectations**:
   - **Dec 01-15 2023**: 57.5K
   - **Dec 15-31 2023**: 50.5K (after deducting 7K)
   - **Jan 01-15 2024**: 43.5K (after deducting 14K)
   
   At the end of the month, you'll owe 50K in total.

5. **Gastos Recurrentes MENSUALES**: 73.3K (This is the sum of the listed monthly expenses).

6. **Fondo de gastos en com√∫n**: You mentioned some common expenses but didn't provide an amount. 

7. **Inversi√≥n**: Not specified.

8. **Playaround**:
   - **Estrategia diferido**: After accounting for the hypothetical 14K debt deferred over months and the 73.3K of monthly recurring expenses, you're left with a total monthly expenditure of 99K and a surplus of 16K.
   - **Estrategia de pagar deudas**: Not specified.

### Feedback & Recommendations:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Always aim to have an emergency fund. Ideally, this should be 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. If unexpected expenses occur, this fund will protect you from going further into debt.

2. **Pay High-Interest Debt First**: Determine the interest rates on all your debts. Prioritize paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first, as it's costing you the most money.

3. **Budget**: Stick to a monthly budget. Your provided recurrent monthly expenses total 73.3K, and you have an income of 115K monthly from InfoTech alone. This means you should have a surplus, which can be used to pay off debt, save, or invest.

4. **Recurring Expenses**: Review your monthly recurring expenses. For example, if you're not using the gym, consider canceling the subscription. Every little bit helps.

5. **Credit Card Strategy**: Be wary of just making minimum payments on credit cards, as this can lead to high interest accruing over time. If possible, pay more than the minimum or the full amount. If you're using credit cards for rewards or cash back, make sure you're not spending just to earn those rewards.

6. **Fondo de gastos en com√∫n**: Establish a fund for common expenses like health consultations or vacations. Contribute a fixed amount monthly, so you're prepared for these expenses when they arise.

7. **Investing**: Once debts are under control, consider investing your surplus money. Investments can provide passive income over time.

8. **Playaround Strategies**: 
   - **Estrategia diferido**: This strategy seems to be based on deferring some debt payments. While this can provide short-term relief, ensure it doesn't result in high interest or penalties in the long run.
   - **Estrategia de pagar deudas**: This wasn't specified, but generally, focus on paying off debts quickly, especially high-interest ones.

Based on the given info, the best strategy would be a combination of budgeting, paying off high-interest debts first, and gradually investing once you have a stable emergency fund and your debts are under control.

Fill up your recommendations for the incomplete parts

ü§ñ **Assistant:**

Certainly. Let's fill in the gaps for your financial strategies:

### Fondo de gastos en com√∫n:

1. **Gatitos**: Allocate a monthly sum for your pets. This should cover food, periodic veterinary visits, and unexpected health issues. Let's say 1K per month.

2. **Salud (consultas medicas)**: Depending on the frequency of doctor visits, medications, and other health-related expenses, you should allocate a monthly sum. As a starting point, consider 2K per month.

3. **Vacaciones**: Set aside a monthly sum to accumulate for vacations. The amount will depend on your vacation habits, destinations, and frequency. For a moderate yearly vacation, consider setting aside 3K per month (36K annually).

### Inversi√≥n:

1. **Research**: Before investing, do thorough research or consult with a financial advisor. Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **Diversify**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps real estate or other avenues. Diversification can help to mitigate risk.

3. **Start Small**: If you're new to investing, start with a small amount and progressively increase as you become more comfortable.

4. **Retirement**: Consider investing in a retirement fund. Even a small monthly contribution can grow significantly over time due to compound interest.

### Playaround:

#### Estrategia de pagar deudas:

1. **List Debts**: Write down all your debts, the total amount owed, monthly payment, and interest rate.

2. **Highest Interest First**: As mentioned before, focus on the debt with the highest interest rate. By paying this off first, you'll save money in the long run.

3. **Extra Payments**: If possible, make extra payments on your debts. This will reduce the total amount of interest you'll pay.

4. **Consolidate**: If you have multiple debts, consider consolidating them into a single loan with a lower interest rate. This can simplify payments and save money.

5. **Avoid New Debt**: While paying off existing debts, try to avoid accumulating new ones. This will fast-track your journey to becoming debt-free.

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Automate Savings**: Set up automatic transfers to a savings account each month. This ensures you're consistently saving.

2. **Review and Adjust**: Every few months, review your budget, expenses, and savings. Adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

3. **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about financial trends, investment opportunities, and best practices. Consider reading financial books, attending workshops, or consulting with experts.

4. **Limit Discretionary Spending**: For non-essential expenses like dining out, set a monthly limit. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself, but having a budget ensures you're not overspending.

5. **Emergency Fund**: While it was mentioned before, it's worth emphasizing the importance of an emergency fund again. This fund can prevent you from diving into debt during unforeseen circumstances.

Using these filled recommendations, prioritize your financial goals, and create a detailed plan. Remember, consistency is key, and it's okay to adjust as you go along.
