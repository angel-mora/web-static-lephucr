What kind of articles Y Combinator staff would like to read about the business Iâ€™m starting?

Y Combinator (YC) is known for its emphasis on startups that can scale and make a significant impact. When it comes to articles or blog posts about a business you're starting, YC staff, mentors, and alumni would likely appreciate the following types of content:

1. **Problem and Solution**: Explain the major problem your business addresses and how your solution is unique, scalable, and effective.

2. **Market Analysis**: Discuss the size and growth potential of your market, how it's currently being served, and where your business fits in.

3. **Traction**: Any data points or stories that demonstrate user demand, growth, retention, or any other key performance indicators.

4. **Product**: How it works, its unique features, and how it stands out from existing solutions.

5. **Business Model**: Explain how your business will make money, the unit economics, and its scalability.

6. **Technical Challenges**: If you have a tech startup, discuss any interesting technical hurdles you've overcome or innovative tech you're using.

7. **Founding Story**: A narrative about why you started this business, your personal connection to the problem, and what drives you. Authentic stories can be compelling.

8. **Team**: Showcase your team's background, expertise, and why you're the right group of people to solve this problem.

9. **Vision**: Explain where you see your company in 5, 10, or 20 years. What's the long-term impact you're hoping to make?

10. **Feedback and Iteration**: Stories about how you've incorporated feedback, pivoted, or made crucial decisions based on real-world experiences.

11. **Cultural and Values Insights**: How you're building your company's culture, values, and how they play a role in your day-to-day operations and decision-making.

12. **Challenges and Learnings**: Honest accounts of challenges you've faced and the learnings you've taken from them can provide valuable insights for other founders.

When writing articles with YC staff or any influential audience in mind, focus on clarity, authenticity, and provide valuable insights or lessons. Remember that these audiences read countless pitches and stories, so make yours stand out by being genuine and demonstrating a deep understanding of the problem you're tackling.
