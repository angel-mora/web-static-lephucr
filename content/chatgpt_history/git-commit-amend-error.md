# Git Commit Amend Error

âžœ  Printavo git:(angel/PT-1778-remove-stripe-specs-for-old-flow-without-defaulted-tax-collection) git commit --amend 'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation' a3c51ce256241b2f70077d395449ae9401ecb7b4
error: pathspec 'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation' did not match any file(s) known to git

ðŸ¤– **Assistant:**

The command you're using has some issues in its syntax. To amend the previous commit with a new commit message, you can use the following command instead:

```bash
git commit --amend -m 'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation'
```

This command will open the last commit for editing and replace the commit message with `'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation'`.

If youâ€™re trying to add specific files or changes to this amended commit, make sure they are staged first. You can do this with:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit --amend -m 'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation'
```

Let me know if this helps or if you're looking to achieve something slightly different!

not the last commit but the one matching that id

To change the message of a specific commit by its hash (like `a3c51ce256241b2f70077d395449ae9401ecb7b4`), youâ€™ll need to use an interactive rebase. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Start an interactive rebase, going back far enough to include the commit you want to amend. For example, if the commit is a few commits back, start with something like:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~5
   ```

   Adjust `5` to however many commits back the target commit is.

2. In the interactive rebase editor that opens, find the commit with the hash `a3c51ce256241b2f70077d395449ae9401ecb7b4`. Change the word `pick` in front of that commit to `reword` (or `edit` if `reword` isnâ€™t available).

3. Save and close the editor. Git will now pause at that commit, allowing you to amend the message.

4. Use `git commit --amend` to change the commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m 'PT-1778: Safely remove old Stripe implementation'
   ```

5. Continue the rebase to apply the remaining commits:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

This will change the message of the specified commit. Be careful with rebasing if you've already pushed these commits to a shared repository, as it rewrites history.
