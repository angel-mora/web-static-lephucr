Puedo obtener una maestrÃ­a cursando cursos de coursera plus?
CuÃ¡les son los mejores cursos para tomar si soy Rails developer? Me gustarÃ­a el de Andrew Ng de mates para data science pero tambiÃ©n otros que cubran mis gaps pues soy programador de bootcamp 



User is interested in Coursera courses, particularly for a master's degree, and wants to cover gaps in their knowledge as a bootcamp-trained Rails developer. They are interested in Andrew Ng's course on math for data science.

Model set context updated.

Coursera Plus offers a wide range of courses, specializations, and professional certificates, but it does not offer full masterâ€™s degrees. However, Coursera does partner with universities to provide online degrees, including masterâ€™s programs. These degree programs are separate from Coursera Plus and have their own application processes and tuition fees.

### Recommended Coursera Courses for a Rails Developer:

1. **Mathematics for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng**: This course is excellent for understanding the mathematical foundations required for data science and machine learning, such as linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

2. **Web Applications for Everybody by Charles Severance**: This series covers building web applications using PHP, but the concepts apply to Rails as well, such as understanding the client-server model, databases, and web security.

3. **Ruby on Rails Web Development**: Coursera has various courses that specifically focus on Ruby on Rails, covering both beginner and advanced topics. Look for courses that cover modern Rails practices, RESTful architecture, and testing.

4. **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Understanding algorithms and data structures is crucial for any developer. Courses like "Data Structures and Algorithms" by UC San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics will help strengthen these skills.

5. **Software Design and Architecture**: This course will help you understand software engineering principles, architectural styles, and how to design scalable applications. Itâ€™s particularly useful for Rails developers who want to design robust and maintainable systems.

6. **Full Stack Web Development**: Even though you're focused on Rails, a full-stack course can provide insight into front-end development, which is valuable for building well-rounded web applications. "Full Stack Web Development with React" by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology covers both the back-end and front-end frameworks.

7. **Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng**: If youâ€™re interested in data science, this specialization is a fantastic choice. It covers various machine learning algorithms and practical applications, which could be useful for integrating AI features into your Rails projects.

8. **Database Management Essentials**: Understanding databases is crucial for web development. This course will help you grasp SQL, database design, and management concepts that are directly applicable to Rails projects.

These courses will help fill in the gaps from your bootcamp training and provide a strong foundation in both development and data science.

Hay algo como el missing semester del MIT en coursera?

The **"Missing Semester of Your CS Education"** from MIT is a popular course that focuses on practical computer science skills that are often not covered in traditional computer science curricula, such as using the command line, version control with Git, shell scripting, and debugging. While Coursera doesn't have an exact equivalent with the same focus, there are several courses and specializations that cover similar practical skills. Here are some Coursera courses that you might find useful:
