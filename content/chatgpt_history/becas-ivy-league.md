I am a mexican web developer with cybersecurity certification and leadership skills. I am starting up a business. Tell me about Ivy League scholarships, grants, summer camps or other kind of programs I could benefit from or apply being from Mexico. (Like Fullbright scholarship or this kind of things).

As a Mexican web developer with cybersecurity certification and leadership skills, there are many scholarships, grants, and programs for which you may be eligible. Ivy League schools and other organizations offer a wide range of programs designed to support individuals from diverse backgrounds, including international students and entrepreneurs. Here are a few opportunities that could be relevant to you:

1. **Fulbright Scholar Program**: As you mentioned, the Fulbright Program offers scholarships for international students to study, research, or teach in the United States. The Fulbright Foreign Student Program is available to postgraduate students and professionals who want to study or conduct research at U.S. universities, including the Ivy League schools.

2. **Harvard Business School (HBS) Scholarships**: Harvard offers numerous scholarships for international students, including ones specific to entrepreneurs. The Horace W. Goldsmith Fellowship, for example, is given to students who have had significant impact in the nonprofit sector and those committed to careers in entrepreneurship.

3. **Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program at Stanford**: Although not an Ivy League, Stanford University's program offers scholarships to study in any graduate program at Stanford, including their highly esteemed Computer Science and Business programs. The program is open to students from all over the world.

4. **The Yale World Fellows Program**: This program is designed for mid-career emerging leaders who have distinguished themselves within their own professions, regions, countries, or at an international level. World Fellows are selected from a wide range of fields and disciplines including government, business, NGOs, public health, journalism, law, and others.

5. **Columbia University International Students Scholarships**: Columbia University offers a number of scholarships to international students. The amount of scholarships varies by schools, but many can cover a significant portion of tuition fees.

6. **Wharton Business School Fellowships**: The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania offers a variety of fellowships for MBA students, some of which are available to international students. The Joseph Wharton Fellowship, for example, is awarded based on the admission application and covers full or partial tuition.

7. **MIT Sloan Fellows MBA Program**: This 12-month immersive program at MIT Sloan (not an Ivy League, but one of the top schools in the world) is tailored to mid-career professionals with a focus on innovation and leadership. The program provides fellowships that could be a good fit for your needs.

Remember that eligibility criteria and application processes can change, and these are highly competitive programs. Always check the specific details from the official sources. It might be useful to connect with the admissions office or international students' office at each school you're interested in to clarify any specific questions. Additionally, consider looking for scholarships and grants available in Mexico for studying abroad; local organizations and the Mexican government might provide additional funding opportunities.
