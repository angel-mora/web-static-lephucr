best books to understand businesses for programmers. I am a ruby on rails developer about to found a startup

Starting a business, especially in the tech space, requires more than just technical know-how. You'll need an understanding of business strategy, marketing, sales, finance, operations, and more. Here's a list of recommended books that will help programmers (like you) understand various facets of business:

1. **"The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries**: This book introduces the concept of Lean Thinking to startups. It emphasizes the importance of adapting and adjusting before any large sums of money or time are spent.

2. **"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future" by Peter Thiel**: This is a deep dive into innovation and how to create something new and valuable.

3. **"The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers" by Ben Horowitz**: A raw and realistic look into the challenges of running a startup and making tough decisions.

4. **"Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers" by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur**: A visual guide to developing a robust business model.

5. **"The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail" by Clayton M. Christensen**: It introduces the concept of disruptive innovation and how established companies can be overtaken by newer technologies and business models.

6. **"How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie**: Not strictly a business book, but it provides invaluable insights into human behavior, communication, and relationship building, all of which are crucial in the business world.

7. **"Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth" by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares**: This offers a look into different channels of growth and how startups can leverage them.

8. **"Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products" by Nir Eyal**: Understand the mechanics behind why some products captivate us and how you can design your product to be more engaging.

9. **"Rework" by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson**: From the founders of Basecamp (and creators of Ruby on Rails), this book provides contrarian business advice that goes against traditional business teachings. It's an excellent read for tech entrepreneurs.

10. **"Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works" by Ash Maurya**: A systematic approach to creating and managing successful startups in an age when companies have to innovate continuously.

11. **"Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days" by Jessica Livingston**: Real-life accounts of challenges and decisions made by founders of successful tech companies.

12. **"Startup Metrics for Pirates" by Dave McClure**: Though not a book, it's a presentation that became very famous in the startup world. It breaks down the essential metrics for evaluating and growing your startup.

13. **"Principles: Life and Work" by Ray Dalio**: While this is more about the principles that guided Dalio in both life and in the creation of Bridgewater Associates (one of the world's largest hedge funds), it provides deep insights into decision-making, management, and designing an effective company culture.

Lastly, even though you're starting a tech company, don't limit yourself to just reading about tech startups. Diverse knowledge from various industries can provide fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.

Good luck with your startup!

You are a very experienced CEO willing to give me a personal advice. Provide the advise thinking in me as a person, reference core advises from those books and tell me hidden things I need to know about venture capital.

Certainly! Stepping into the shoes of an experienced CEO, I'll craft some advice for you:

---

**Dear [Your Name],**

Firstly, congratulations on your journey into entrepreneurship. Founding a startup and venturing into the unknown is both exhilarating and challenging. Your background as a developer equips you with a unique perspective and technical know-how, which will be invaluable.

Here are some pieces of advice, grounded in the wisdom of the books you've referenced and from personal experience:

1. **Adaptability is Key**: As Eric Ries states in "The Lean Startup", the world of startups is filled with uncertainty. Your initial idea or vision will likely evolve. Be ready to learn from customer feedback, iterate rapidly, and pivot if necessary.

2. **Seek True Innovation**: Taking insights from Peter Thiel's "Zero to One", ensure that your product or solution isn't just an iteration of something existing but strives to change the game in its own unique way.

3. **Tough Times Await, and That's Okay**: As Ben Horowitz emphasizes, entrepreneurship is not all roses. There will be challenges, tough decisions, and times where everything seems to be going wrong. In these moments, stay resilient, lean on your network, and remember the bigger picture.

4. **Relationships Matter**: Dale Carnegie's teachings remind us that, beyond technology and strategy, business is about people. Cultivate genuine relationships, understand human psychology, and approach conflicts with empathy.

5. **Stay Grounded in Value**: When designing your product, as Nir Eyal suggests in "Hooked", think deeply about the value you're providing to users. Are you making their lives better? Easier? More enjoyable?

6. **Understand Your Business Model**: Before seeking venture capital, be clear on how you intend to make money. Osterwalder and Pigneur's "Business Model Generation" can be a great tool in refining this understanding.

Speaking of venture capital, let's delve into some lesser-discussed realities:

a. **VC is Not Always the Right Answer**: Venture capital is just one of many funding options. It's seductive due to the large sums, but it comes with its own expectations and pressures. Sometimes, bootstrapping, angel investors, or other funding sources might be more suitable for your startup's phase or nature.

b. **Loss of Control**: With VC funding, you'll likely give up a portion of equity and may have to adhere to decisions influenced or dictated by your investors. Ensure that any VC you partner with aligns with your vision and values.

c. **High Expectations**: VCs expect high returns on their investments. This often means aggressive growth and scaling targets. Make sure you're prepared for the pace and scale they demand.

d. **Due Diligence is Mutual**: Just as VCs will thoroughly vet your startup, you must vet them. Speak to other founders they've funded, understand their working style, and ensure they add value beyond just money.

e. **Prepare for Long-term Commitment**: Taking VC funding is almost like entering a marriage. It's a long-term partnership, so ensure it's with people you respect and can envision working with for many years.

Lastly, always remember that your well-being is paramount. Founding a startup can consume you, but ensure you maintain balance, mental health, and personal relationships. Your personal resilience and well-being will be the bedrock upon which your startup's success is built.

Best wishes,

[Experienced CEO Name]

While this advice is tailored based on the content of the books and the realm of venture capital, every entrepreneurial journey is unique. Trust your instincts, be adaptable, and surround yourself with mentors and peers who can guide and support you.

Now provide concrete stories of things that caused the learnings for the recommendations

Absolutely, context often provides clarity. Let's delve into some anecdotal stories to illustrate these learnings:

1. **Adaptability is Key**
   - **Story**: Consider the origins of **Slack**. The platform began as an internal communication tool for a gaming company named Tiny Speck, which was working on a game called Glitch. The game failed, but the team pivoted to focus on the communication tool, turning it into a multi-billion-dollar company. This underscores the importance of adaptability and the willingness to pivot based on what the market demands.

2. **Seek True Innovation**
   - **Story**: When **Apple** introduced the iPhone in 2007, there were already smartphones in the market. However, Apple's product was vastly different, combining an iPod, a phone, and an "Internet communication device". Instead of just iterating on the existing idea of a smartphone, Apple redefined the entire category.

3. **Tough Times Await, and That's Okay**
   - **Story**: **Airbnb** faced severe challenges in its early days. At one point, the founders were deep in debt and had to sell novelty cereals (Obama O's and Cap'n McCains) to stay afloat. Their persistence, combined with rethinking their strategies, ultimately led to Airbnb's colossal success.

4. **Relationships Matter**
   - **Story**: **Y Combinator** (YC), a renowned startup accelerator, places a strong emphasis on the relationships between co-founders. They've noticed that startups where founders have deep-rooted, positive relationships tend to fare better. This is because trust, mutual respect, and effective communication are foundational to navigating the ups and downs of startup life.

5. **Stay Grounded in Value**
   - **Story**: Remember the app, **Yo**? It was a simple app where users could just send the word "Yo" to each other. It gained quick popularity and even secured significant funding. But it didn't offer lasting or substantial value to users, and its popularity waned rapidly. This story emphasizes the need for genuine value in products.

As for the realities of venture capital:

a. **VC is Not Always the Right Answer**
   - **Story**: **MailChimp** is a great example of a company that never took VC funding. By bootstrapping, they maintained full control and grew at their own pace, building a company that is now worth billions.

b. **Loss of Control**
   - **Story**: Eduardo Saverin, one of the original co-founders of **Facebook**, had his share diluted without his full knowledge, leading to lawsuits and a strained relationship with Mark Zuckerberg. The world of VC and equity is complex, and founders need to be vigilant.

c. **High Expectations**
   - **Story**: **Color**, a photo-sharing app, raised $41 million before it even launched. However, the high expectations that came with such funding and subsequent missteps led to its downfall, proving that large funding rounds can sometimes be a double-edged sword.

d. **Due Diligence is Mutual**
   - **Story**: **Zirtual**, a virtual assistant service, suddenly shut down overnight, blindsiding its 400 employees. One of the cited reasons was a misunderstanding between the founders and investors about the terms of their funding and burn rate.

e. **Prepare for Long-term Commitment**
   - **Story**: **Snapchat** received a buyout offer from Facebook in its early days, but CEO Evan Spiegel declined. His commitment to his vision meant navigating the complex world of venture capital, scaling the company, and ultimately taking it public.

Each of these stories carries lessons and insights that can provide guidance and caution to budding entrepreneurs. The journey of building a startup is filled with twists, turns, highs, and lows, and learning from others' experiences can offer invaluable navigation aids.

provide integral advice about positive and negative cases I need to always remember as I move on in the path

Absolutely, reflecting on both positive and negative cases can provide valuable lessons as you embark on your entrepreneurial journey. Here are some emblematic cases for you to remember:

### Positive Cases:

1. **Dropbox**: 
   - **Advice**: Focus on the user experience.
   - **Story**: Dropbox made file-sharing and syncing look easy, even though the problem was complex. Their minimalist design and easy-to-use interface garnered a lot of user attention and made them stand out.

2. **Spanx**:
   - **Advice**: Trust your gut feeling and address underserved markets.
   - **Story**: Sara Blakely started Spanx with no background in fashion or business. She trusted her gut, identified a gap in the market, and created a product that many women didn't know they needed until it existed.

3. **Shopify**:
   - **Advice**: If a market leader exists, differentiate by serving a niche audience.
   - **Story**: When other e-commerce platforms catered to large businesses, Shopify focused on enabling small businesses to set up online stores easily, creating a massive loyal user base.

### Negative Cases:

1. **Theranos**:
   - **Advice**: Never mislead stakeholders; honesty and integrity are paramount.
   - **Story**: Elizabeth Holmes promised a revolutionary blood-testing technology. However, instead of admitting the technology's shortcomings, she misled investors, partners, and patients. This resulted in one of the biggest scandals in startup history and serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of dishonesty.

2. **Peeple**:
   - **Advice**: Be cautious about ethical implications.
   - **Story**: Peeple was an app dubbed as "Yelp for People", allowing individuals to rate others. It faced significant backlash due to privacy concerns and the potential for harassment and bullying. This underscores the need to consider the broader societal implications of your product.

3. **Quibi**:
   - **Advice**: Extensive funding and big names don't guarantee success; product-market fit does.
   - **Story**: With over $1.75 billion in funding and led by industry veterans, Quibi aimed to revolutionize mobile streaming. However, they misjudged user behavior and needs, leading to their downfall within six months of launch.

### Integral Advice:

- **Celebrate Small Wins**: The journey will be long and arduous. Celebrate minor victories to maintain morale and momentum.
  
- **Be Open to Feedback**: While your vision is crucial, be open to feedback from users, team members, and mentors. They can offer insights you might overlook.

- **Stay Resilient**: Not everything will go as planned. Learn from the failures, pick yourself up, and move forward.

- **Prioritize Your Well-being**: An entrepreneur's mental and physical health is critical. Ensure you're taking care of yourself, so you're in the best position to take care of your business.

- **Surround Yourself with a Supportive Team**: You can't do it all alone. Find co-founders or employees who complement your skills and share your passion.

Remember, every entrepreneur, whether they've tasted success or faced failure, has unique insights to offer. By understanding and internalizing the lessons from both positive and negative cases, you can navigate your startup's challenges more effectively.
