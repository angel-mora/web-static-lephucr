How can I put my body muscle dimensions in a web page? Like with Unreal Engine or WebGL, is there any library?

To showcase your body muscle dimensions on a webpage, you can use technologies like Unreal Engine or WebGL, which are powerful tools for rendering 3D models and graphics. Here are a few approaches and libraries you might consider:

1. **Unreal Engine with Web Export:**
   - Unreal Engine is primarily used for game development but can be adapted for web use. 
   - You can create a detailed 3D model of your body with muscle dimensions in Unreal Engine.
   - Then, use a plugin or tool to export this model to a web-compatible format. Unreal Engine has support for exporting to HTML5, although this might require some technical expertise.

2. **WebGL Libraries:**
   - WebGL is a web standard for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. 
   - **Three.js**: This is one of the most popular WebGL libraries. It's user-friendly and has a large community and documentation. You can import 3D models created in other software and display them on a webpage.
   - **Babylon.js**: Another powerful library for 3D rendering in the browser. It's known for its advanced features and is also well-documented.

3. **Modeling and Rigging:**
   - Regardless of the tool you choose, you'll need a 3D model of your body. This can be done using 3D modeling software like Blender, Maya, or ZBrush. 
   - After modeling, you might need to rig the model (if you want it to have animation or movement).

4. **Implementing on a Web Page:**
   - Once your model is ready and exported to a web-compatible format (like .glb for Three.js), you can implement it on a webpage.
   - You'll need to write JavaScript code to load the model, control camera views, and possibly interact with the model (like zooming in on specific muscles).

5. **Custom Solutions:**
   - If you need more custom features, like interactive muscle measurements or dynamic changes in muscle size, you might need to write more complex code or shaders.

6. **Hosting and Optimization:**
   - Ensure your web page is optimized for performance, as 3D models can be resource-intensive.
   - Choose a hosting solution
